	<h1>~ "dreamlike" Lyrics ~</h1>
	<br>
	<h3>dreamlike</h3>
	<p>I'm cold<br>
The land is barren like me<br>
Not gold<br>
A worn out torn up color to be<br><br>

I don't want to leave<br>
Cause you make me feel safe<br>
You're not good for me<br>
But I can't help imagining the fate<br><br>

But hey, that's just what it allows<br>
The ground is just white now<br>
The floor will always give out<br>
It's just what this nuclear winter's all about<br><br>

Seeing the dust makes me sad<br>
I know<br>
It's just eighteen years that were bad<br>
So it goes<br><br>

Bright eyes I wonder about<br>
What it would be like to love<br>
I need some warmth in the drought<br>
Seeing you gives my heart a shove<br><br>

But hey, that's just what it allows<br>
The ground is just white now<br>
The floor will always give out<br>
It's just what this nuclear winter's all about<br><br>

Apocalypse apologists <br>
Stay away <br>
I know and don’t care about what<br>
You have to say<br><br>

I have a thirst<br>
Unable to be quenched<br>
It’s just the worst<br>
Too dry to be drenched<br><br>

It’s been the end<br>
For way too long<br>
So I won’t stand<br>
When I sing this song<br><br>

But hey, that's just what it allows<br>
The ground is just white now<br>
The floor will always give out<br>
It's just what this nuclear winter's all about<br><br>

It's just what this nuclear winter's all about
