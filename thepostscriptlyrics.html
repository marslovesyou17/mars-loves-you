	<p>So before we like, become friends I'd like to give you a warning<br><br>

Know me<br>
If you want to<br>
Show me<br>
That you'll stay<br><br>

Dis-moi que je suis fol<br>
I've heard it from them all<br>
I'm too much for everyone<br>
Don't say "It's fine" if you're gonna run<br><br>

And leave me alone<br>
Cause I'd rather be alone<br>
Than be left by who I love<br>
I hate that fatal shove<br><br>

Know me<br>
If you want to<br>
Show me<br>
That you'll stay<br><br>

I've got a history<br>
I'm a liability<br>
True stories I'll tell you<br>
Will seem like tragedies too<br><br>

Loving me is hugging a dying cactus<br>
I hurt but it hurts you too <br>
Knowing me is just such a burden<br>
I'm a problem, what can I do?<br><br>

I don't wanna be an issue you feel you wanna fix<br>
Cause there's no way to save someone halfway down the styx<br>
I’m a house fire that can’t be put out<br>
You can’t stop it by yourself now<br><br>

I’m nice, I’m fun, I’m insecure<br>
“Good advice” but are you sure?<br>
I’m empathetic and pathetic<br>
But at least not psychopathic<br><br>

Know me<br>
If you want to<br>
Show me<br>
That you'll stay<br><br>

I've got a history<br>
I'm a liability<br>
True stories I'll tell you<br>
Will seem like tragedies too<br><br>

Loving me is hugging a dying cactus<br>
I hurt but it hurts you too <br>
Knowing me is just such a burden<br>
I'm a problem, what can I do?<br><br>

Do I mastermind this shit and trick everyone<br>
Into being my friends and then start the fun<br>
Or do I warn them not to get close to me<br>
Because I don’t want them to ever leave<br><br>

I should do the selfless thing and warn you<br>
I’m a ticking time bomb about to go boom<br>
You shouldn’t stick around to get burned<br>
I will be the lesson that you have to learn<br><br>

I've got a history<br>
I'm a liability<br>
True stories I'll tell you<br>
Will seem like tragedies too<br><br>

Loving me is hugging a dying cactus<br>
I hurt but it hurts you too <br>
Knowing me is just such a burden<br>
I'm a problem, what can I do?<br><br>

Know me<br>
If you want to<br>
Show me<br>
That you'll sta-</p>

	<p>Every afternoon I have you on my mind<br>
But I know that you're far away, across the line<br>
I try to fill the void, but I can't find someone else<br>
I'm drowning in the social sea, I need some help<br><br>

I have a greenhouse of plenty for now<br>
But need someone to help build the world somehow<br>
Always absent, lacking goodbyes<br>
I taste belief and then you leave my side<br><br>
￼
You only come around once every blood moon <br>
Only to leave, and say that you'll see me soon<br>
And I look up to see the night sky<br>
And hope that by some chance I'll see red tonight<br><br>

You only come around once every blood moon <br>
To hang with me and dance to our favorite tune<br>
And I'll look up to see the night sky<br>
And hope that by some chance I'll see red tonight<br><br>

So like a ghost you disappear once again<br>
But I'm a kid on Christmas when you come back in<br>
I know you're busy and have your own life<br>
But I do too and you know I still try<br><br>

With barely any friends I'm looked down upon<br>
People just insult me and have their fun<br>
But they're just the largest of parasites<br>
Who see that I'm human when they look in my eyes<br><br>

You only come around once every blood moon <br>
Only to leave, and say that you'll see me soon<br>
And I look up to see the night sky<br>
And hope that by some chance I'll see red tonight<br><br>

You only come around once every blood moon <br>
To hang with me and dance to our favorite tune<br>
And I'll look up to see the night sky<br>
And hope that by some chance I'll see red tonight<br><br>

The one I long to be closer with<br>
Not have our talks be a total myth<br>
I light a candle and hope that the small flame<br>
Doesn't burn out and bring me so much pain<br><br>

You only come around once every blood moon <br>
Only to leave, and say that you'll see me soon<br>
And I look up to see the night sky<br>
And hope that by some chance I'll see red tonight<br><br>

You only come around once every blood moon <br>
To hang with me and dance to our favorite tune<br>
And I'll look up to see the night sky<br>
And hope that by some chance I'll see red tonight</p>

	<h3 id="pyck">promises you can't keep</h3>
	<p>A silhouette crossing the door frame<br>
I wonder if I took it too far<br>
Or if you did and you're giving me the blame<br>
This is my least favorite part<br><br>

Everyone eventually fucks up<br>
And doesn't wanna admit they're wrong<br>
You could've at least given a 'heads up'<br>
Before you got my hopes up too long<br><br>

I wish you handled me with delicacy<br>
That one night so I wouldn't be lonely<br><br>

You said you'd love me till the end of time<br>
But I know now all of that was a lie<br>
You said you couldn't hate me if you tried<br>
But now I reminisce on back when you were mine<br><br>

Don't make promises you can't keep <br>
Don't pretend like our connection was deep<br>
Cause clearly it wasn't for you to do that<br>
To betray your own promises, that's too bad<br><br>

[interlude]<br><br>
		
I wish you handled me with delicacy<br>

Don't make promises you can't keep <br>
Don't pretend like our connection was deep<br>
Cause clearly it wasn't for you to do that<br>
To betray your own promises, that's too bad<br><br>

I never took you as a foolish liar<br>
Or a brute lacking empathy, fuel to the fire<br>
Why would you tell me you would never leave me?<br>
Don't make promises that you can't keep<br><br>

You said you'd love me till the end of time<br>
But I know now all of that was a lie<br>
You said you couldn't hate me if you tried<br>
But now I reminisce on back when you were mine<br><br>

Don't make promises you can't keep <br>
Don't pretend like our connection was deep<br>
Cause clearly it wasn't for you to do that<br>
To betray your own promises, that's too bad</p>

	<h3 id="gt">ghost town</h3>
	<p>I thought I did everything right<br>
In the dark, for you I became a light<br>
Picked flowers, I chose all the right words<br>
So high, we said hello to the birds<br><br>

I built you a city on a cloud<br>
Then you left me with a ghost town<br>
I gave you my keys and a kiss<br>
You left me with red eyes in the mist<br><br>

You came over to watch a movie<br>
But I found out you just wanted my body<br>
I said I wanted to take it slow<br>
Then out the door I saw your body go<br><br>

I built you a city on a cloud<br>
Then you left me with a ghost town<br>
I gave you my keys and a kiss<br>
You left me with red eyes in the mist<br><br>

Now the door is closed<br>
You say I deserve better, I say I know<br>
Now I sit in this abandoned town<br>
Of what could've been before it drowned<br><br>

I built you a city on a cloud<br>
Then you left me with a ghost town<br>
I gave you my keys and a kiss<br>
You left me with red eyes in the mist

	<p>I can't deal with the small things<br>
I can never find shelter from the storm<br>
I can't stop rust from finding my rings<br>
I can't get dark clouds to not form<br><br>

when the room begins to fall<br>
And I can’t see at all<br>
my heart races, throbs and dies <br>
Can’t stop tear drops clouding my eyes<br><br>

Every time it rains it's a damn monsoon <br>
Floods my head at dawn, dusk and noon<br>
It's never ending anytime soon<br>
Dark clouds cover up my moon<br><br>

Every time it rains it's a damn monsoon <br>
Floods my head at dawn, dusk and noon<br>
It's never ending anytime soon<br>
Dark clouds cover up my moon<br><br>
 
I run in a field from the rainstorm<br>
I can't find the trees or a shelter here<br>
I think that life has lost form<br>
I wish that this monsoon would disappear <br><br>

when the room begins to fall<br>
And I can’t see at all<br>
my heart races, throbs and dies <br>
Can’t stop tear drops clouding my eyes<br><br>

Every time it rains it's a damn monsoon <br>
Floods my head at dawn, dusk and noon<br>
It's never ending anytime soon<br>
Dark clouds cover up my moon<br><br>

Every time it rains it's a damn monsoon <br>
Floods my head at dawn, dusk and noon<br>
It's never ending anytime soon<br>
Dark clouds cover up my moon<br><br>

All the places from my dreams<br>
Are dry as a bone<br>
All the places from my dreams<br>
Are dry as a bone<br><br>

Every time it rains it's a damn monsoon <br>
Floods my head at dawn, dusk and noon<br>
It's never ending anytime soon<br>
Dark clouds cover up my moon<br><br>

Every time it rains it's a damn monsoon <br>
Floods my head at dawn, dusk and noon<br>

	<h3 id="co23">class of 2023</h3>
	<p>I used to walk these streets at night<br>
At sixteen years old<br>
Now at eighteen I just drive<br>
And fit the adult mold<br><br>

The sky filled up with silence<br>
with blue and grey as I roamed<br>
The bold clouds split for cities<br>
The rain held back till I got home<br><br>

I work a job, I got a boss<br>
I have a passion but I feel lost<br>
Is the world ready for me?<br>
Am I ready for it?<br><br>

From toy stores to coffee shops<br>
And high school to college<br>
The ghosts guide us through the world<br>
Until we fly above it<br><br>

I don't feel human<br>
Word knives cut too deep<br>
I'm ready to go<br>
Somewhere that's not asleep<br><br>

I don't wanna be brainless<br>
Who reap the shit they sow<br>
But my life hasn't been painless<br>
So that means I'll grow<br><br>

Now the rain waits for no one<br>
Cities don't make the clouds split<br>
Now the pain makes it no fun<br>
and that old coat you wore doesn't fit<br><br>

I work a job, I got a boss<br>
I have a passion but I feel lost<br>
Is the world ready for me?<br>
Cause I'm ready for it<br><br>

From toy stores to coffee shops<br>
And high school to college<br>
The ghosts guide us through the world<br>
Until we fly above it<br><br>

I don't feel human<br>
Word knives cut too deep<br>
I'm ready to go<br>
Somewhere that's not asleep<br><br>

It's time, it's time<br>
It's time to go<br>
It's time, It's time <br>
It's time to go<br>
It's time, it's time<br>
It's time to go<br>
It's time, It's time<br>
It's time to go<br><br>

It's time, It's time<br>
It's time to grow<br>
It's time, it's time<br>
It's time to grow<br>
It's time, It's time <br>
It's time to grow<br>
It's time, it's time<br>
It's time to grow<br><br>

From toy stores to coffee shops<br>
And high school to college<br>
The ghosts guide us through the world<br>
Until we fly above it<br><br>

I don't feel human<br>
Word knives cut too deep<br>
I'm ready to go<br>
Somewhere that's not asleep<br><br>

It's time, it's time<br>
It's time to go<br>
It's time, It's time <br>
It's time to go<br>
It's time, it's time<br>
It's time to go<br>
It's time, It's time<br>
It's time to go<br><br>

It's time, It's time<br>
It's time to grow<br>
It's time, it's time<br>
It's time to grow<br>
It's time, It's time <br>
It's time to grow<br>
It's time, it's time<br>
It's time to grow</p>

	<p>Melting in front of the window<br>
Showing our souls to each other<br>
I haven't done it in a long time<br>
But I'm seeing a brand new color<br><br>

Stardust makes me wonder<br>
If my dreams will come to fruition<br>
We share a fear of that thunder<br>
In my dreams are bad premonitions<br><br>

You don't have to be strong <br>
You don't have to hide<br>
You don't have to stand tall<br>
If you feel you're gonna cry<br><br>

You don't have to be a saint<br>
Don't let it fuel your apprehensions<br>
I know you say you've made mistakes<br>
But that doesn't change your intentions<br><br>

There's been gaps in communication <br>
I always wish that there weren't <br>
I keep on building bridges<br>
But they keep on getting burnt<br><br>

Stardust makes me wonder <br>
If all of our pain and our hurt<br>
All of that rolling thunder<br>
Will pass by or get worse<br><br>

You don't have to be strong <br>
You don't have to hide<br>
You don't have to stand tall<br>
If you feel you're gonna cry<br><br>

You don't have to be a saint<br>
Don't let it fuel your apprehensions<br>
I know you say you've made mistakes<br>
But that doesn't change your intentions<br><br>

You don't have to be strong <br>
You don't have to hide<br>
You don't have to stand tall<br>
If you feel you're gonna cry<br><br>

You don't have to be a saint<br>
Don't let it fuel your apprehensions<br>
I know you say you've made mistakes<br>
But that doesn't change your intentions

	<p>I’m not free <br>
When the skeleton in my closet is me <br>
Help me <br>
When the mirror bursts in flames into debris <br><br>

I’m at a loss for words <br>
I’m staring at myself and I don’t like it <br>
Nobody with me is that tight-knit <br>
Oh what can I do then?<br><br>

I’m staring at the clock tryn to be carefree<br>
I just want the greatest for me<br>
Call me selfish call me crazy<br>
Perfect life and perfect body<br><br>

One small thing<br>
Makes me want to lose it<br>
Makes me wanna puke and<br>
Makes me wanna starve for a week<br>
Not eat anything until I’m weak<br>
Let me go<br>
Don’t let me know<br>
I know

	<p>Cavetown songs still remind me of you<br>
Your peaceful life that you'll continue<br>
We haven't talked since January first<br>
The pain I feel is no longer the worst<br><br>

Dreaming of finding someone like you<br>
Wishing I had someone else to talk to<br>
About the things that matter<br>
The way that life's a ladder<br><br>

I hate that I miss you to this day<br>
Though I was the one who went away<br>
You forced me to go<br>
This I hope you know<br><br>

Fuck you James, for all that you did<br>
You destroyed me, I was just a kid<br>
You're gonna wish you believed me then<br>
Instead of your fake friends while I pleaded<br><br>

Fuck you James, for all that time<br>
You fit in my life like a lifeline <br>
I thought you were here to stay<br>
Now you've got me filled with hate<br><br>

You told me that I had demons<br>
You ghosted me for days on end<br>
Until I gave up fighting for me<br>
You got what you wanted, I wasn't free<br><br>

Fuck you James, for all you knew<br>
Every time I want to forgive you<br>
The voice in my head says "don't"<br>
"If you think he'll change, he won't"<br><br>

Fuck you James, you're no saint<br>
For everything that you taint<br>
You're a wolf in sheep's clothing<br>
But since then I've been growing</p>

	<p>The light is out the window<br>
I used to be chained in the basement<br>
But after pill love, though<br>
I'm not outside, just at the window casement<br><br>

Bullet proof glass<br>
Oh will this be the last?<br>
If I stop my savior now,<br>
Will I get through or go down?<br><br>

Baby, you're keeping me out of the dark<br>
But you also keep me away from the light<br>
Baby, you know I can't stay forever<br>
But I thank you for fighting a good fight<br><br>

If I abandon what I know keeps the light nearby<br>
Will the window lock disappear or will I simply die?<br>
I can't decide I can't decide<br>
I don't just want to run and hide<br><br>

Baby, you're keeping me out of the dark<br>
But you also keep me away from the light<br>
Baby, you know I can't stay forever<br>
But I thank you for fighting a good fight<br><br>

If I take you down, will you drag me down too?<br>
If you drag me down, will I never ever move<br>
again?<br><br>

Baby, you're keeping me out of the dark<br>
But you also keep me away from the light<br>

You like to think you're in control<br>
That the world revolves around you<br>
You're just a piece in the game<br>
And I just like to look like I’m tame<br><br>

But you could never know<br>
What I am made of<br>
I could let blood rain<br>
You could go insane<br><br>

You like to think that you’re the queen<br>
That you’re fighting formidably<br>
But the truth is that is me<br>
I’m controlling how I’m seen<br><br>

If I want you to be scared of me<br>
You will be, you will be<br>
If I want you to be loving me<br>
You will be, you will be<br><br>

I’ve got more control than you think<br>
I can disappear in a blink<br>
All you are is a fucking disaster<br>
You’re just a pawn, and I’m the chess master<br><br>

You like to think you know it all<br>
But you know nothing<br>
You will not get your money <br>
Isn’t it so funny<br><br>

The world is my oyster<br>
The oyster is your cage<br>
A little bit of rain there<br>
Is a flood for you, too much to bear<br><br>

You like to think that you’re the queen<br>
That you’re fighting formidably<br>
But the truth is that is me<br>
I’m controlling how I’m seen<br><br>

If I want you to be scared of me<br>
You will be, you will be<br>
If I want you to be loving me<br>
You will be, you will be<br><br>

I’ve got more control than you think<br>
I can disappear in a blink<br>
All you are is a fucking disaster<br>
You’re just a pawn, and I’m the chess master</p>

My hair is pretty <br>
I think I have too much weight<br>
And I just wanna be skinny<br><br>

I wish I was simply smaller<br>

I know that I should be grateful<br>
But looking down is painful<br><br>

I want to be skinny <br>
And not have to be so tall<br>
I just want to be pretty<br>
And just wake up more small <br><br>

Mirrors are my friend<br>
Until it's time to take off my shirt<br>
I just try to pretend<br>
That seeing my body doesn't hurt<br><br>

Stressing about people seeing my skin<br>
I order a size up in everything<br>
Wishing people wouldn't comment on my body<br>
Cause every time I hear it my mind just gets foggy<br><br>

I try to get on the scale every morning<br>
To check that my weight isn't soaring<br>
I'll skip a meal, try to feel<br>
Less hungry, what's the deal? <br><br>

I want to be skinny <br>
And not have to be so tall<br>
I want to be pretty<br>
And just wake up more small <br><br>

Mirrors are my friend<br>
Until it's time to take off my shirt<br>
I just try to pretend<br>
That seeing my body doesn't hurt<br><br>

When I grab the silverware<br>
It tells me no, tells me no<br>
Angels and devils in me<br>
I don't know, I don't know<br><br>

I can't tell the difference between them<br>
This light never seemed so grey then<br>
I don't know right from wrong here<br>
I can't ever seem to quell my fear<br><br>

I want to be skinny <br>
And not have to be so tall<br>
I just want to be pretty<br>
And just wake up more small <br><br>

Mirrors are my friend<br>
Until it's time to take off my shirt<br>
I just try to pretend<br>
That seeing my body doesn't hurt</p>
