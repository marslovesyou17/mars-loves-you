	<p>I'll bring the highs, fight the lows<br>
Put on shoes, change my clothes<br>
All to feel, my heart swell<br>
Look up at you, under your spell<br><br>

You turned my lonely nights into<br>
A fire burning the color blue<br>
You're there for me and I'm there for you<br>
What more could I want to pursue?<br><br>

The rose bushes you planted<br>
Turned this desolate planet<br>
Into a garden of dreams<br>
Now I'm not bursting at the seams<br><br>

Anywhere I go now<br>
Where everyone is sitting down<br>
Gravity pulls me straight to you<br>
To stay here forever there's nothing I wouldn't do</p>

	<p>Meet me at the diner<br>
At the heart of the borough<br>
We will dine in<br>
Study the menu thoroughly<br><br>

We'll have our last meal<br>
Savor it while you can<br>
I know we won't win<br>
So please just take my hand<br><br>

Because I don't want to<br>
Run run run<br>
Out of my house to my car<br>
Trying to get away as far<br>
As I can go<br><br>

Run run run<br>
I'm tired of running<br>
I'm tired of suffering<br>
And nobody knows<br><br>

So now that there's nothing to do<br>
I just want to sit there with you<br>
And ponder the things we could've done<br>
But remember all of the wars we won<br><br>

But I don't want to<br>
Run run run<br>
Out of my house to my car<br>
Trying to get away as far<br>
As I can go<br><br>

Run run run<br>
I'm tired of running<br>
I'm tired of suffering<br>
And nobody knows<br><br>

It's the end of the world<br>
And nobody knows<br>
Nobody knows<br>
Nobody knows<br>
Nobody knows<br><br>

Nobody knows<br>
Nobody knows<br>
Nobody knows<br>
Nobody knows<br><br>

Meet me at the diner<br>
At the heart of the borough<br>
We will dine in<br>

We'll have our last meal<br>

I know we won't live<br>
So please just take my hand</p>

	<p>I won't forget the good times we've had<br>
The only thing sad's when they'll split us like that<br>
Say you'll come back for me don't leave me blue<br>
I'll bury my heart in the sand just for you<br><br>

You can dig it up if I see you again<br>
It's 6 feet below the spot we sat when<br>
We watched the sunset, I cried a ton<br>
You said "I hope you smile when this is all done"<br><br>

Cheeks wet with a gallon of tears<br>
I sat in your arms<br>
You said "don't dwell on the fear<br>
I'm sorry for the scars"<br><br>

I can just see it<br>
You leaving so slowly<br>
I can just feel it<br>
The lack of you around me<br><br>

You told me to not write this song<br>
You told me to smile when you are gone<br><br>

How do you expect me to live<br>
And not wait around for your return<br>
I think we could figure out a plan so thin<br>
You write my phone number and don't let it burn<br><br>

I can't stop dreading the last day for us<br>
I can't stop sweating how could someone gain my trust<br>
The nights that we spent in each others arms<br>
They tell me the end is not far<br><br>

Cheeks wet with a gallon of tears<br>
I sat in your arms<br>
You said "don't dwell on the fear<br>
I'm sorry for the scars"<br><br>

I can just see it<br>
You leaving so slowly<br>
I can just feel it<br>
The lack of you around me<br><br>

You told me to not write this song<br>
You told me to smile when you are gone<br><br>

I promise<br>
I promise that I will<br><br>

Hang up the pictures of you and me<br>
I'll smile with some tears whenever I see<br>
I'll hope you end up with a better life<br>
Somewhere out there with beauty and light<br>
I'll never forget you if this is goodbye<br>
I promise I'll smile but I cant say I won't cry<br><br>

Cheeks wet with a gallon of tears<br>
I sat in your arms<br>
You said "don't dwell on the fear<br>
I'm sorry for the scars"<br><br>

I forgive you<br>
It's not your fault<br>
I love you<br>
For my wound you didn't add salt<br><br>

You told me to not write this song<br>
You told me to smile when you are gone</p>

	<p>Please don't become a memory<br>
I don't think I can bear it<br>
But I guess I'll have to<br><br>

Will you still remember me<br>
After years I can't shake it<br>
My feelings about you<br><br>

Will you please just keep a card for me<br>
With my number, next to your photo I.D.<br>
I know you'll haunt me in my dreams<br>
In the photos taken of you and me<br><br>

I don't think you love me<br>
As much as I love you<br>
Maybe that's a good thing<br><br>

We were made to break slowly<br>
To the ruins of something true<br>
I can't speak so I'll sing<br><br>

Will you please just keep a card for me<br>
With my number, next to your photo I.D.<br>
I know you'll haunt me in my dreams<br>
In the photos taken of you and me<br><br>

Your voice telling me "please don't cry"<br>
But I can't help it when I say goodbye<br>
I can't help but love the way you lie<br>
To protect my feelings, to not make me cry<br><br>

Please just keep a card for me<br>
With my number, next to your photo I.D.<br>
I know you'll haunt me in my dreams<br>
In the photos taken of you and me<br><br>

Goodbye

	<p>There's something so comforting<br>
About waiting around to die<br>
No thoughts in my mind<br>
Or time to question why<br>
Maybe I want to be this way<br>
Finding comfort in all the grey<br><br>

The dark clouds never clear<br>
I wish that I could disappear<br>
Under the ground<br>
Never to be found<br><br>

Walk right by me<br>
I don't care anymore<br>
I'll think of the sea<br>
As I walk out the door<br><br>

I'll just watch life as it shatters<br>
Cause nothing ever really matters<br>
I am gonna die anyway<br>
I'll sink in the soil at the end of the day<br><br>

I think when I sit in the yard<br>
This peace never lasts cause life deals its cards<br>
Time is numbered and I am too<br>
No time to think, ten assignments are due<br><br>

But I don't have anger<br>
I don't have regret<br>
I don't care at all<br>
Now I have no sweat<br><br>

Walk right by me<br>
I don't care anymore<br>
I'll think of the sea<br>
As I walk out the door<br><br>

I'll just watch life as it shatters<br>
Cause nothing ever really matters<br>
I am gonna die anyway<br>
I'll sink in the soil at the end of the day<br><br>

	<p>I stand watching the sun setting over the ocean<br>
And the waves tell my heart to open<br>
But I'm afraid the sun will leave me forever<br>
And it leaves just as I thought I was clever<br><br>

Oh it can't see this light<br>
I bring to the morning<br>
I bring in these tides<br>
When it's sunny or storming<br>
Oh the moon must rise<br>
And hold me closely<br>
Oh I wish that<br>
Good things would last<br><br>

You know I can't hold on forever<br>
For things that always stay never<br>
The moon told me<br>
It'd be back but just differently<br><br>

Oh it can't see this light<br>
I bring to the darkness<br>
I bring in these tides<br>
With their carefree and sharpness<br>
Oh the sun must rise<br>
And hold me closely<br>
Oh I wish that<br>
Good things would last<br><br>

I know they'll back<br>
They just won't remember me<br>
I'll feel the lack<br>
Cause I'll never be free</p>

	<p>Is it obvious<br>
That I still love you?<br>
That I savor us?<br>
That I want to?<br><br>

We are still friends<br>
But I still want more<br>
To not let this end<br>
To reopen that door<br><br>

When you're near I'm fine<br>
But I miss you all the time<br>
And when I'm in your arms<br>
I still feel all your charms<br><br>

When I look up at you<br>
And think, I still feel blue<br>
There's nothing I can do<br>
But I still love you<br><br>

I remember that night on the beach<br>
When I restated my feelings through<br>
That though what your parents preach<br>
I still want you<br><br>

Our sparks still seem to cut through<br>
I sit in front of that door<br>
It's open a crack I see you<br>
I peek but still I want more<br><br>

When you're near I'm fine<br>
But I miss you all the time<br>
And when I'm in your arms<br>
I still feel all your charms<br><br>

When I look up at you<br>
And think, I still feel blue<br>
There's nothing I can do<br>
But I still love you<br><br>

When you're gone I feel alone<br>
I'll miss you till the end of time<br>
And until then when we are grown<br>
I'll say I'm fine and start to cry<br><br>

When I look up at you<br>
And think, I still feel blue<br>
There's nothing I can do<br>
But I still love you<br><br>

When you're near I'm fine<br>
But I miss you all the time<br>

	<p>Why does nobody know things that are obvious?<br>
It's like they're blind<br>
To this phenomenon so sad and ravenous<br>
I'd like this to unwind<br><br>

There's a cracked-up creature<br>
That sleeps under my bed<br>
It waits for me to let down my guard<br>
So that I could end up dead<br>
Or maybe snatch an arm or two<br>
He could do it if he wanted to<br>
He could cook my head in a stew<br>
Nobody knows so please get a clue<br><br>

Everybody vomits words that coax the creature out<br>
But they're clueless<br>
Self righteous indignation when I cover up the spout<br>
So relentless<br><br>

	<p>It's not funny<br>
Other people's trauma<br>
You never stop talking<br>
Let me add a comma<br>
There's no god damn compromise<br>
Cause nobody opens their eyes<br>
Empty promises don't even bother<br>
As reliable as a deadbeat father<br><br>

Hiding your insults behind jokes<br>
I see through your pretty hoax<br>
Is this rude? I don't give a fuck<br>
I hope this hits like a semi truck<br>
Insult humor<br>
Ruins friendships<br>
Venom in veins<br>
Causing an eclipse<br><br>

It's not ever funny<br>
Making my skin itch<br>
Get offended when I fight back<br>
You're a hypocrite bitch<br>

If you never respect me<br>
I will never respect you<br>
If you don't change eventually<br>
For you there will be no room<br><br>

I'm tired of being walked all over<br>
I'm tired of condescending people<br>
Invalidate me, ruin my mood<br>
You give me such attitude<br><br>

I have worked on self esteem<br>
Confidence I want to see<br>
Not to live here just to please<br>
In my life you're a bad disease<br><br>

I have tried my whole damn life<br>
To get along with everyone and just be nice<br>
But I don't let myself be a doormat<br>
I don't let myself tolerate that<br><br>

Once I got a good self esteem<br>
All the motherfuckers say I'm so mean<br>
While I've been trying to get clean<br>
You act ten when you're actually a teen<br><br>

The ones who stick around you<br>
Are just like you or they're doormats too<br>
There's the difference between them and I<br>
They get used until they die<br><br>

If I could have some more time<br>
A place to go where I can hide<br>
When things just won't get better<br>
I'm underneath the weather<br>

I wish I could stay forever<br>
I don't want it to be true<br>

I've never met no one like you<br>
And without you I will be blue<br>
Nobody else interests me<br>
I won't get over you easily<br><br>

Hey, we meet once again<br>
Tonight in this room<br>
We do the usual<br>
Talk and stare at the moon<br><br>

Out of the window<br>
The view is so nice<br>
Won't last forever<br>
But this will suffice<br><br>

If things were different<br>
I'd go for broke<br>
Go for broke<br>
Go for broke<br><br>

But since they aren't I left<br>
Before you woke<br>
Before you woke<br>
Before you woke<br><br>

If I could I'd marry this comfort<br>
And it would be alright<br>
We'd sleep in the same bed<br>
Every single night<br><br>

Here's the only place<br>
We can see each other<br>
Tomorrow I leave but<br>
For now I pull the covers<br><br>

If things were different<br>
I'd go for broke<br>
Go for broke<br>
Go for broke<br><br>

But since they aren't I left<br>
Before you woke<br>
Before you woke<br>
Before you woke<br><br>

And you know the puzzle pieces<br>
Of our lives don't fit<br>
But even that doesn't<br>
Make me wanna quit<br><br>

So we'll make the most of what we have<br>
And keep the memories of what we had<br>
Shut off the days that make us sad<br>
We'll fantasize and just be glad that<br><br>

If things were different<br>
We'd go for broke<br>
Go for broke<br>
Go for broke<br><br>

But since they aren't I left<br>
Before you woke<br>
Before you woke<br>
Before you woke<br><br>

If things were different<br>
We'd go for broke<br>
Go for broke<br>
Go for broke<br><br>

I can't fall asleep<br>
My stomach is turning<br>
I want to weep<br>
I have to wake up in five hours<br>
Already spent two in bed<br>
The thoughts in my head are getting louder<br>
I just wish I was dead<br><br>

Checking my alarm clock<br>
Over and over again<br>
Fidgeting with my socks<br>
I should've slept at ten<br>
Hung up on life<br>
And things I have to do<br>
But I never have time<br>
Cause now it's almost two<br><br>

It's like sleep is a program<br>
In the computer of my mind<br>
That no matter how many times I ran<br>
It hasn't responded all night<br>
Close the software<br>
Reboot it all<br>
Just cause I care<br>
I'm not trying to stall<br><br>

I guess I'll down some melatonin<br>
Before twelve so I can sleep<br>
And hope that it will sink in<br>
For at least six hours deep</p>

	<h3 id="The_Last_Garden">The Last Garden</h3>
	<p>I'll drive alone through the streets of this town<br>
Looking out at the people around<br>
I will admire them before we fall away<br>
Cause the world ends today<br><br>

There's one garden left in the world now<br>
For things to end up like this I don't know how<br>
So when my mother tells me to exercise<br>
I'll light the house on fire with these eyes<br><br>

I'll drive to work every day<br>
Hoping my fear will go away<br>
Even though I know it won't<br>
I think about it they tell me don't<br>
And maybe if I go to the park<br>
Daily I won't be a shark<br>
In a pool full of my own blood<br>
Or in the dark on my knees in the mud<br><br>

There's one garden left in the world now<br>
For things to end up like this I don't know how<br>
So when my mother starts to magnify<br>
I'll say I'm done with trying to satisfy<br>
There's one garden left in the world now<br>
For things to end up like this I don't know how<br>
So when my father tells me to dry my eyes<br>
I'll say that's the kind of shit that makes me despise<br><br>

You all just don't understand<br>
I don't need you to hold my hand<br>
None of this shit has been planned<br>
No more gardens, no more land<br>
When I drive at night<br>
I'll wish the world was a wasteland<br>
And that a ditch could hold me tight<br>
Keep me safe from a life so bland<br>
Surely the dark will let me in<br>
Cause nobody else ever did<br>
This way maybe I will win<br>
At life leaving my kin<br><br>

I'll lie to every therapist, psychiatrist <br>
And adult in my life<br>
Think about it every day, all the time<br>
Where's my knife?<br><br>

There's one garden left in the world now<br>
For things to end up like this I dont know how<br>
So when my parents ask me why<br>
Instead of answering I'll just fucking sigh<br><br>

For shit to end up like this I dont know how<br>
For things to fuck up like this I dont know how<br>
For shit to end up like this I dont know how<br>
For things to fuck up like this I don't know how</p>
