	<p>I'm cold<br>
The land is barren like me<br>
Not gold<br>
A worn out torn up color to be<br><br>

I don't want to leave<br>
Cause you make me feel safe<br>
You're not good for me<br>
But I can't help imagining the fate<br><br>

But hey, that's just what it allows<br>
The ground is just white now<br>
The floor will always give out<br>
It's just what this nuclear winter's all about<br><br>

Seeing the dust makes me sad<br>
I know<br>
It's just eighteen years that were bad<br>
So it goes<br><br>

Bright eyes I wonder about<br>
What it would be like to love<br>
I need some warmth in the drought<br>
Seeing you gives my heart a shove<br><br>

But hey, that's just what it allows<br>
The ground is just white now<br>
The floor will always give out<br>
It's just what this nuclear winter's all about<br><br>

Apocalypse apologists <br>
Stay away <br>
I know and don’t care about what<br>
You have to say<br><br>

I have a thirst<br>
Unable to be quenched<br>
It’s just the worst<br>
Too dry to be drenched<br><br>

It’s been the end<br>
For way too long<br>
So I won’t stand<br>
When I sing this song<br><br>

But hey, that's just what it allows<br>
The ground is just white now<br>
The floor will always give out<br>
It's just what this nuclear winter's all about<br><br>

It's just what this nuclear winter's all about

	<p>After you kiss me my mind gets foggy<br>
When you hold me my body feels lovely<br>
And you make me feel small<br><br>

After you leave I smell you on my bed<br>
After you leave I see you in my head<br>
And I don't mind at all<br><br>

I wanna see all of you right now<br>
I wanna see all of you endowed<br>
Your lips feel like your tongue<br>
They chose me I'm the one<br><br>

Tonight you can make me swoon<br>
Don't wait till the moon's maroon<br>
You make me your angel every day<br>
Just don't lead this angel astray<br><br>

When you touch my face I feel so dizzy<br>
And my touch makes you wanna get busy<br>
You kiss me so hard<br><br>

When you set off my fireworks and I set off yours<br>
It makes my head spin and my angel wings soar<br>
You're playing your card<br><br>

I wanna see all of you right now<br>
I wanna see all of you endowed<br>
Your lips feel like your tongue<br>
They chose me I'm the one<br><br>

Tonight you can make me swoon<br>
Don't wait till the moon's maroon<br>
You make me your angel every day<br>
Just don't lead this angel astray<br><br>

Don't keep this angel away<br>
Don't lead this angel astray<br>
Don't let this angel fade away<br>
Please just let this angel stay<br><br>

Don't lead this angel far away<br>
Don't hurt this angel that way<br>
Let me be your angel every day<br>
Please just let this angel stay<br><br>

I wanna see all of you right now<br>
I wanna see all of you endowed<br>
Your lips feel like your tongue<br>
They chose me I'm the one<br><br>

Tonight you can make me swoon<br>
Don't wait till the moon's maroon<br>
You make me your angel every day<br>
Just don't lead this angel astray

	<p>Got nothing to do<br>
Got nothing to prove<br>
Got no life to live<br>
Got no gift to give<br><br>

Don't wanna get out of bed<br>
I can't get out of my head<br>
Cause there's nowhere to go<br>
I'll reap the shit I sow<br><br>

And when the semester starts<br>
The void in me will be gone<br>
It'll give me comfortability<br>
Give me some shit to focus on<br><br>

Give me something to focus on<br>
Give me something to focus on<br>
Give me something to focus on<br>
Give me something to focus on<br><br>

Give me something to focus on<br>
Give me something to focus on<br>
Give me something to focus on<br>
Give me something to focus on<br><br>

I'll be away from my boyfriend but<br>
At least I'll have something to do<br>
I'll try to listen to my gut<br>
Because I've got too much to lose<br><br>

And when the semester starts<br>
The void in me will be gone<br>
It'll give me comfortability<br>
Give me some shit to focus on<br><br>

Give me something to focus on<br>
Give me something to focus on<br>
Give me something to focus on<br>
Give me something to focus on<br><br>

Give me something to focus on<br>
Give me something to focus on<br>
Give me something to focus on<br>
Give me something to focus on<br><br>

Give me something to focus on<br>
Give me something to focus on<br>
Give me something to focus on<br>
Give me something to focus on<br><br>

Give me something to focus on<br>
Give me something to focus on<br>
Give me something to focus on<br>
Give me something to focus on</p>

	<p>My skin like butter<br>
In the hot hot sun<br>
When you're around<br>
I come undone<br><br>

You kinda make me ache<br>
The icing on the cake<br>
Feels like a simulation<br>
Afraid of confrontation<br><br>

When you said that I'm a god<br>
Did you really mean it?<br>
And when you said that I'm hot<br>
Did you really see it?<br><br>

You don't mind when I cry<br>
You're such a nice guy<br>
You're quite a lightning strike<br>
Loving you is dreamlike<br><br>

Now I let you in the back door<br>
Stay a while, come around more<br>
Put me under you, put me under you<br>
Until when you say my name I say "who?"<br><br>

When you said that I'm a god<br>
Did you really mean it?<br>
And when you said that I'm hot<br>
Did you really see it?<br><br>

You don't mind when I cry<br>
You're such a nice guy<br>
You're quite a lightning strike<br>
Loving you is dreamlike<br><br>

If you saw inside my mind<br>
You might lose your mind<br>
I know you know I'm kind<br>
I think I want you to be mine<br><br>

When you said that I'm a god<br>
Did you really mean it?<br>
And when you said that I'm hot<br>
Did you really see it?<br><br>

You don't mind when I cry<br>
You're such a nice guy<br>
You're quite a lightning strike<br>
Loving you is dreamlike

	<p>I hope this works out<br>
I hope we don't drown<br>
I hope we get out<br>
Of this place and time now<br><br>

I wake with my head<br>
On your chest<br>
Here you lead<br>
Me to come rest<br><br>

Take me from the void<br>
Outside the window<br>
Drown out all the noise<br>
Let me keep my eyes closed<br><br>

I like how you play dumb<br>
Then say something smart<br>
You take away the numb<br>
Make love in the dark<br><br>

You bring warmth to the winter<br>
Now I wish on a star<br>
To make me a true winner<br>
In loving from afar<br><br>

I wake with my head<br>
On your chest<br>
Here you lead<br>
Me to come rest<br><br>

Take me from the void<br>
Outside the window<br>
Drown out all the noise<br>
Let me keep my eyes closed<br><br>

Don't make this<br>
A waste of time<br>
Make me yours<br>
I'll make you mine<br><br>

Don't make me your secret<br>
Don't make me your secret<br>
Don't make me your secret<br><br>

I wake with my head<br>
On your chest<br>
Here you lead<br>
Me to come rest<br><br>

Take me from the void<br>
Outside the window<br>
Drown out all the noise<br>
Let me keep my eyes closed</p>

	<p>I have some issues not<br>
Worrying about what'll happen<br>
And I have a lot of thoughts<br>
But I'll just try to make it<br><br>

And I know<br>
They can't<br>
Possibly see me<br><br>

And I can't go on any longer<br>
But I can't go away<br>
Just let me be a bit stronger<br>
So I get through and stay<br><br>

And I can't stop feeling this hunger<br>
And it won't go away<br>
Just let me know if I made a blunder<br>
So I get through and stay stay stay stay<br><br>

They must be staring at me<br>
But not for good reason<br>
I wanna run and hide<br>
And sing a melody<br><br>

And I know<br>
They can't<br>
Possibly see me<br><br>

And I can't go on any longer<br>
But I can't go away<br>
Just let me be a bit stronger<br>
So I get through and stay<br><br>

And I can't stop feeling this hunger<br>
And it won't go away<br>
Just let me know if I made a blunder<br>
So I get through and stay stay stay stay<br><br>

No, I can't see myself<br>
In the mirror<br>
I can't breathe in this hell<br>
But now it's clearer<br><br>

I still can't go on any longer<br>
And I can't go away<br>
Just let me be a bit stronger<br>
So one day I could stay<br><br>

And I can't stop feeling this hunger<br>
And it won't go away<br>
Just let me know if I made a blunder<br>
So I get through and stay stay stay stay</p>

	<p>Maybe someday I'll be grateful for the body I've got<br>
Maybe today I'll realize problems never go unfought<br>
There's no real sunrise to light up all the dark<br>
There's still shadows and caverns making their mark<br><br>

And even though I feel numb today<br>
I'll feel something someday either way<br>
My friends will try to make me laugh<br>
Cause nobody likes to see me sad<br><br>

And that's why I just cry alone<br>
I don't want them to hear me through the phone<br>
But it's okay<br>
At least I'm not this close to taking my life<br><br>

And even though I feel numb today<br>
I'll feel something someday either way<br>
My friends will try to make me laugh<br>
Cause nobody likes to see me sad<br><br>

I'm not happy<br>
I'm not sad<br>
I'm just alive<br><br>

(I hope I'll have someone there with me)<br>
(One day someone who stays unconditionally)

	<p>Counting the ways<br>
For you to leave<br>
Counting the days<br>
Till you're tired of me<br><br>

I got a sweet treat<br>
Each day of the week<br>
Felt like a feat<br>
But our ship had a leak<br><br>

I knew the end<br>
Wasn't far<br>
Even that didn't mend<br>
My broken heart<br><br>

Counting the times<br>
I gave up myself<br>
Only to find<br>
You put me on a shelf<br><br>

I hate the ways<br>
I miss your embrace<br>
The touch of your face<br>
Don't know what to say<br><br>

I got a sweet treat<br>
Each day of the week<br>
Felt like a feat<br>
But our ship had a leak<br><br>

I knew the end<br>
Wasn't far<br>
Even that didn't mend<br>
My broken heart<br><br>

I lost my mind for a big fucking loser<br>
Who made me wish that I found out much sooner<br>
That I was an experiment for you to try out<br>
And you didn't share, you took the whole amount<br><br>

Your insane fucking pressure to give all of me<br>
Now just leaves me feeling barren and empty<br>
And now out my window, all that I see<br>
Is a doomsday wasteland world torn at the seams<br><br>

Empty and goddamn useless<br>
This loss is so fucking ruthless<br>
The calendar's bare bones and empty<br>
But I still don't feel free<br><br>

You devoured me<br>
All I gave to you<br>
I need me back<br>
But I can't undo<br><br>

I got a sweet treat<br>
Each day of the week<br>
Felt like a feat<br>
But our ship had a leak<br><br>

I knew the end<br>
Wasn't far<br>
Even that didn't mend<br>
My broken heart<br><br>

I tried to be your lover<br>
I was your advent calendar<br>
The treats were mine<br>
But you stole my time<br><br>

I knew the end<br>
Wasn't far<br>
Even that didn't mend<br>
My broken heart

	<p>I have a castle<br>
Made by just me<br>
It was quite a battle<br>
To make it be<br><br>

I'm in a wasteland<br>
It's hard to live<br>
Within the dusty sand<br>
What really gives?<br><br>

You fucked it up<br>
I'm not a toy<br>
You're not a man<br>
You're just a boy<br><br>

You'll suffocate in regret<br>
I won't respond to a single text<br>
I won't feel bad for your guilt<br>
I'll revel in this castle I built<br><br>

They think it was natural<br>
That I was born with a castle<br>
But I built it from the ground up<br>
To explain that is a hassle<br><br>

You fucked it up<br>
I'm not a toy<br>
You're not a man<br>
You're just a boy<br><br>

You'll suffocate in regret<br>
I won't respond to a single text<br>
I won't feel bad for your guilt<br>
I'll revel in this castle I built<br><br>

You couldn't bring it down if you tried<br>
And if you did I couldn't tell<br>
All that you could ever do is lie<br>
And even then you couldn't sell<br><br>

Fuck you for leaving me here<br>
Fuck you for causing my tears<br>
Give me back my precious time<br>
What now is yours once was mine<br><br>

You fucked it up<br>
I'm not a toy<br>
You're not a man<br>
You're just a boy<br><br>

You'll suffocate in regret<br>
I won't respond to a single text<br>
I won't feel bad for your guilt<br>
I'll revel in this castle I built<br><br>

You fucked it up (You fucked it up)<br>
I'm not a toy (You fucked it up)<br>
You're not a man (You fucked it up)<br>
You're just a boy (You fucked it up)<br><br>

You'll suffocate in regret (You fucked it up, you fucked it up)<br>
I won't respond to a single text (You fucked it up, you fucked it up)<br>
I won't feel bad for your guilt (You fucked it up, you fucked it up)<br>
I'll revel in this castle I built (You fucked it up, you fucked it up)</p>

	<p>Every man<br>

Every land<br>
The opposite of heaven<br><br>

He could be two<br>
He could be three<br>
He could fuck you<br>
He could fuck me<br><br>

I can't breathe<br>

Happens to be<br>
Making us die<br><br>

What stage<br>
Of earth are we in?<br>
Every man<br>

Every man<br>

Every hand<br>
Is bloodied from us<br><br>

I'm tired of being seen and not heard<br>
Tired of being thrown out like garbage<br>
So I'll live my life and say words<br>
Silence is the victim of my carnage<br><br>

	<p>Red lines every night<br>
We're on the plane but it can't take flight<br>
I can't keep the feeling down<br>
That one night I'll sink and I'll drown<br><br>

Here on the floor of my room<br>
Blue carpet, the ocean, will be my tomb<br>
Blood in the water like bait<br>
Alone here I'll drown, I'll drown as I ache<br><br>

Nobody's ever everloving<br>
So what do you do when you feel lonely?<br>
When everybody is good for nothing?<br>
Cause I'll never have a one and only<br><br>

Nobody is everloving<br>
Now I leave the water running<br>
In hopes that it'll fill up my head<br>
so I won't ever think again<br><br>

Nobody loves you forever<br>
You may think you're very clever<br>
But nothing ever lasts a lifetime<br>
All of it's just to waste your prime<br><br>

Nobody's ever everloving<br>
So what do you do when you feel lonely?<br>
When everybody is good for nothing?<br>
Cause I'll never have a one and only<br><br>

(They will all)<br>
Procrastinate, invalidate<br>
Never appreciate<br>
Ignore you, ditch you,<br>
Gaslight too, get a clue!<br><br>

Tell lies with dry eyes,<br>
Never ever compromise<br>
Smoke a joint, what's the point<br>
Only ever disappoint<br><br>

Will I find someone who<br>
Doesn't leave my life?<br>
Who doesn't bring more pain<br>
And wants to make things right<br><br>

Nobody's ever everloving<br>
So what do you do when you feel lonely<br>
When everybody is good for nothing?<br>
Cause I'll never have a one and only<br><br>

	<p>
You dug my grave throughout the week<br>
And pushed me in on Friday<br>
You called me pretty by the creek<br>
And said "I have to go my way"<br><br>

You shoveled in the dirt and left<br>
And never looked twice<br>
But little did you know your theft<br>
Of my life had a price<br><br>

I rose up from the ground<br>
You couldn't bring me down<br>
You gave me heaven and took it away<br>
So now I'm back to make you pay<br><br>

You watched as I died<br>
On beds and couches as you lied<br>
With your actions about us<br>
So I wouldn't put up a fuss<br><br>

I need to kill you for real<br>
Inside my head to deal<br>
With how you made me feel<br>
You lost me, I was a steal<br><br>

I rose up from the ground<br>
You couldn't bring me down<br>
You gave me heaven and took it away<br>
So now I'm back to make you pay<br><br>

I'm sorry but I had to kill you dead<br>
Because of those foolish words you said<br>
And how you treated me when I had bled<br>
So someday you'll be out of my head<br><br>

I rose up from the ground<br>
You couldn't bring me down<br>
You gave me heaven and took it away<br>
So now I'm back, I made you pay<br><br>

I made you pay</p>

	<p>I'm a little tired of catastrophe<br>
The potently abusive pageantry<br>
Of drama<br>
My trauma<br><br>

I'm a little tired of tragedy<br>
The viral debilitating malady<br>
I'm exhausted<br>
The ground's frosted<br><br>

I can see you<br>
For what you really are<br>
I can feel you<br>
When I look outside my car<br><br>

I'm not blind<br>
I'm not whipped<br>
Now that I'm<br>
In the postscript<br><br>

I'm a little tired of remembering<br>
Your pestering and then my trembling<br>
Cause you<br>
You knew<br><br>

That I would give in eventually<br>
So I began complying helplessly<br>
So much<br>
I couldn't do<br><br>

I can see you<br>
For what you really are<br>
I can feel you<br>
When I look outside my car<br><br>

I'm not blind<br>
I'm not whipped<br>
Now that I'm<br>
In the postscript<br><br>

When the song doesn't have a climax<br>
When the pain seems to have no reason<br>
You have to give it one<br>
You have to be the sun<br><br>

That lights your own world up<br>
You can't rely on love<br>
To water all your flowers<br>
It'll never be enough<br><br>

I can see you<br>
For what you really are<br>
I can feel you<br>
When I look outside my car<br><br>

I'm not blind<br>
I'm not whipped<br>
Now that I'm<br>
In the postscript</p>
