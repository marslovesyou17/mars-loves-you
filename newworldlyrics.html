	<h3 id="Calling">Calling</h3>
	<p>The moon has been brighter lately<br>
It reminds me of you<br>
I hope you know you're saintly<br>
Cause you know I do<br><br>

I know that's ironic<br>
You're not one for worshipping<br>
You know I'm psychotic<br>
But you sure worship me<br><br>

I can't sleep without calling<br>
I can't rest until we're talking<br>
I can't die until we're trying<br>
With you I feel that I'm flying<br><br>

I love living by your side<br>
In any way I can do<br>
I won't rest until I've tried<br>
Cause I love calling...... you <br><br>

You say you're like Satan but act like a saint<br>
You say you're a devil but I know that you ain't <br>
You say you're a fool and that I'm royalty<br>
You promise me that you won't ever leave<br><br>

But please don't make promises you can't keep <br>
Cause that's happened too many times to me<br>
I've been played before<br>
Pick me up off the floor <br><br>

I can't sleep without calling<br>
I can't rest until we're talking<br>
I can't die until we're trying<br>
With you I feel that I'm flying<br><br>

I love living by your side<br>
In any way I can do<br>
I won't rest until I've tried<br>
Cause I love calling...... you

	<h3 id="goodthings">Good things (re-recorded)</h3>
	<p>I stand watching the sun setting over the ocean<br>
And the waves tell my heart to open<br>
But I'm afraid the sun will leave me forever<br>
And it leaves just as I thought I was clever<br><br>

Oh it can't see this light<br>
I bring to the morning<br>
I bring in these tides<br>
When it's sunny or storming<br>
Oh the moon must rise<br>
And hold me closely<br>
Oh I wish that<br>
Good things would last<br><br>

You know I can't hold on forever<br>
For things that always stay never<br>
The moon told me<br>
It'd be back but just differently<br><br>

Oh it can't see this light<br>
I bring to the darkness<br>
I bring in these tides<br>
With their carefree and sharpness<br>
Oh the sun must rise<br>
And hold me closely<br>
Oh I wish that<br>
Good things would last<br><br>

I know they'll back<br>
They just won't remember me<br>
I'll feel the lack<br>
Cause I'll never be free</p>

	<h3 id="yfmb">you forgot my birthday</h3>
	<p>You forgot my birthday<br>
I don't know if I forgive you<br>
It sounds like I just don't <br>
But I only don't know what to do<br><br>

It's been days <br>
You haven't mentioned it<br>
Thinking of ways<br>
To bring attention to it<br><br>

But next time we speak I'll smile<br>
I'll laugh and say "It's been a while"<br>
You're nice but what you did was mean<br>
The last time I spoke to you, I was eighteen<br><br>

You forgot my birthday<br>
I had a lovely night<br>
My boy held me close<br>
But I still have spite<br><br>

It's been days <br>
You haven't mentioned it<br>
Thinking of ways<br>
To bring attention to it<br><br>

But next time we speak I'll smile<br>
I'll laugh and say "It's been a while"<br>
You're nice but what you did was mean<br>
The last time I spoke to you, I was eighteen<br><br>

It's been months now and I'm still waiting<br>
For you to remember I exist <br>
Call me stupid for not just explaining<br>
But can you blame me for being pissed?<br><br>

Next time we speak I'll smile<br>
I'll laugh and say "It's been a while"<br>
You're nice but what you did was mean<br>
The last time I spoke to you, I was eighteen</p>

	<h3 id="ritr">rose in the rain</h3>
	<p>You're Home<br>
More Than Any Residence I've Had<br>
You're Home<br>
You Shower Me With Praise And That<br>
Sweet Presence Of Yours<br>
The Calm In My Storm<br><br>

You Hold<br>
The Power To Snap Me In Two<br>
You Hold<br>
Me When I'm Drenched In Dark Blue<br>
And Whisper Affirmations In My Ear<br>
You Tell Me Not To Ever Disappear<br><br>

I Hear Thunder In The Back Of My Mind<br>
But You Always Tell Me I'll Be Fine<br>
When The Others Say It I Feel They Lie<br>
I Believe You, Only You, Cuz You're Mine<br><br>

You Stay<br>
Here With Me To Cross Another Bridge<br>
You Stay <br>
Hear Me Out I'm Terrified Just A Smidge<br>
Promise That You'll Never Leave<br>
And Into My Life You'll Continue To Weave<br><br>

I Hear Thunder In The Back Of My Mind<br>
But You Always Tell Me I'll Be Fine<br>
When The Others Say It I Feel They Lie<br>
I Believe You, Only You, Cuz You're Mine<br><br>

Hey Boy<br>
You're Gonna Fuck Me<br>
In Every Sense Of The Phrase<br><br>

Hey Boy<br>
You're Gonna Love Me<br>
It'll Leave You In A Daze<br><br>

I Hear Thunder In The Back Of My Mind<br>
But You Always Tell Me I'll Be Fine<br>
When The Others Say It I Feel They Lie<br>
I Believe You, Only You, Cuz You're Mine
