	<h1>~ "class of 2023" Lyrics ~</h1>

	<h3>class of 2023</h3>
	<p>I used to walk these streets at night<br>
At sixteen years old<br>
Now at eighteen I just drive<br>
And fit the adult mold<br><br>

The sky filled up with silence<br>
with blue and grey as I roamed<br>
The bold clouds split for cities<br>
The rain held back till I got home<br><br>
    
I work a job, I got a boss<br>
I have a passion but I feel lost<br>
Is the world ready for me?<br>
Am I ready for it?<br><br>

From toy stores to coffee shops<br>
And high school to college<br>
The ghosts guide us through the world<br>
Until we fly far above it<br><br>

I don't feel human<br>
Word knives cut too deep<br>
I'm ready to go<br>
Somewhere that's not asleep<br><br>

I don't wanna be brainless<br>
Who reap the shit they sow<br>
But my life hasn't been painless<br>
So that means I'll grow<br><br>

Now the rain waits for no one<br>
Cities don't make the clouds split<br>
Now the pain makes it no fun<br>
and that old coat you wore doesn't fit<br><br>

I work a job, I got a boss<br>
I have a passion but I feel lost<br>
Is the world ready for me?<br>
Cause I'm ready for it<br><br>

From toy stores to coffee shops<br>
And high school to college<br>
The ghosts guide us through the world<br>
Until we fly far above it<br><br>

I don't feel human<br>
Word knives cut too deep<br>
I'm ready to go<br>
Somewhere that's not asleep<br><br>

It's time, it's time<br>
It's time to go<br>
It's time, It's time <br>
It's time to go<br>
It's time, it's time<br>
It's time to go<br>
It's time, It's time<br>
It's time to go<br><br>

It's time, It's time<br>
It's time to grow<br>
It's time, it's time<br>
It's time to grow<br>
It's time, It's time <br>
It's time to grow<br>
It's time, it's time<br>
It's time to grow<br><br>

From toy stores to coffee shops<br>
And high school to college<br>
The ghosts guide us through the world<br>
Until we fly far above it<br><br>

I don't feel human<br>
Word knives cut too deep<br>
I'm ready to go<br>
Somewhere that's not asleep<br><br>

It's time, it's time, it's time to go<br>
It's time, it's time, it's time to go<br>
It's time, it's time, it's time to go<br>
It's time, it's time, it's time to go
