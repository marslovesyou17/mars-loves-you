	<p>Trapped in a space that isn't mine<br>
Looking out to see the stars align<br>
I thought it was a good sign<br>
I was wrong<br>
Stuck in a pace that slows no time<br>
Winter to summer, fruit of the vine<br>
I thought I was out of line<br>
I was wrong<br><br>

I know I know<br>
I know it all now<br>
Don't show don't show<br>
Don't show me how<br><br>

This life (this life)<br>
This love (This love)<br>
This game (this game)<br>
This knife (this knife)<br>
This shove (this shove)<br>
This flame (this flame)<br>
I see it all and it's the same<br>
(Oh, oh oh, oh oh)<br>
I see it all and it's the same<br><br>

Walking the streets no longer mine<br>
Looking up to see the bright moon shine<br>
No longer any time<br>
I was wrong<br><br>

I know I know<br>
I know it all now<br>
Don't show don't show<br>
Don't show me how<br><br>

This life (this life)<br>
This love (this love)<br>
This game (this game)<br>
This knife (this knife)<br>
This shove (this shove)<br>
This flame (this flame)<br>
I see it all and it's the same<br>
(Oh, oh oh, oh oh)<br><br>

I see it all and yet my<br>
My flames are blue<br>
My palms are red<br>
Nothing I can do<br>
My garden's dead<br>
My story's true<br>
My lonely bed<br>
Can't break this glue<br>
Stuck in my head<br>
This life<br>
It's a fight<br>
And a game<br><br>

This life (this life)<br>
This love (this love)<br>
This game (this game)<br>
This knife (this knife)<br>
This shove (this shove)<br>
This flame (this flame)<br>
I see it all and it's the same<br>
(Oh, oh oh, oh oh)<br>
I see it all and it's the same

	<p>A hundred signs<br>
Never knowing what they'll mean<br>
In the end<br>
Reputations never clean<br>
Hypocrisy<br>
The ones who claim anyone's wrong<br>
But I can see<br>
The ones who hide are not that strong<br><br>

Say "Why do you stress and strain<br>
When you can just say my name?<br>
I promise it won't be in vain"<br>
"Okay"<br><br>

They cancel quick<br>
They post idiosyncrasies<br>
It makes me sick<br>
But society hasn't got to me<br><br>

Say "Why do you stress and strain<br>
When you can just say my name?<br>
I promise it won't be in vain"<br>
"Okay"<br><br>

So tell me I'll be okay<br>
That I'll see another day<br>
Just tell me the world is sweet<br>
I don't care, just lie to me<br><br>

Say "Why do you stress and strain<br>
When you can just say my name?<br>
And it'll all be okay"<br>
Okay?"<br>
Say "Why do you stress and strain<br>
When you can just say my name?<br>
I promise it won't be in vain"<br>
"Okay"</p>

After my torn heart mends<br>
And I'm not filled with sorrow"<br><br>

I try and fail to evade you<br>
When I walk down my hometown street<br>
You say "I'll try to persuade you"<br>
As you comedically glance at me<br><br>

(Ooh)<br>
You say "What do you need?"<br>

I run down the stairs crying<br>

You follow me down<br>

Then right then I start dying<br>

Happens when you're around<br><br>

You say "What do you need?"<br>

	<p>I thought that one day<br>
	would be nice<br>
But I was late,<br>
now I'm paying the price<br><br>

I can't see<br>
You with me<br>
Anymore<br>
And I<br>
Couldn't find a way<br>
To go say "hey"<br>
Now it's too late<br>
And I'll be okay<br><br>

The second I saw<br>
My stone heart just sank<br>
And you don't know<br>
It's you I can thank<br><br>

I can't see<br>
You with me<br>
Anymore<br>
And I<br>
Couldn't find a way<br>
To go say "hey"<br>
Now it's too late<br>
And I'll be okay<br><br>

You were always there<br>
To make me feel sparks or make me feel somewhat scared<br>
But there's no fireworks anymore<br>
Now it feels like you just closed the door<br><br>

Yeah you can't pass me by without<br>
Making me sad or making me want to cry<br>
I know it won't be the same<br>
Your life flying by, you won't even know my name<br><br>

I can't see you with me<br>
It's really hard to know who you wanna be<br>
When I saw him with you<br>
The light of my phone screen all I saw was blue<br><br>

Now I paint the picture<br>
Of you in my mind<br>
So I'll remember<br>
Had to leave you behind<br><br>

I can't see<br>
You with me<br>
Anymore<br>
And I<br>
Couldn't find a way<br>
To go say "hey"<br>
Now it's too late...</p>

	<p>I got attached to a friend group<br>
They made me happy for a while<br>
Lack of attention threw me for a loop<br>
And with them they took my smile<br>
I got attached to soon-to-be boyfriend<br>
He makes me laugh with a flirty smile<br>
I am terrified it'll end<br>
We've been in purgatory for a while<br><br>

I feel like I'm going crazy<br>
Yea people leave me daily<br>
My mind affects my body<br>
Every night leaves me foggy<br>
I'm breakable but I'm also not<br>
I'm breakable I can't fucking stop<br><br>

I got attached to my damn best friend<br>
They brightened up my darkest days<br>
They just fucking let it bend<br>
We're still friends but it ain't the same<br>
I got attached to a new friend right<br>
After Christmas singing Adam's song<br>
Now they're off the grid and I'm alone at night<br>
I guess that shit didn't last long<br><br>

Yeah I feel like I'm going crazy<br>
Yeah people leave me daily<br>
My mind affects my body<br>
Every night leaves me foggy<br>
I'm breakable but I'm also not<br>
I'm breakable I can't fucking stop<br><br>

I got attached to another friend<br>
They like the way I fucking sing<br>
If I picked up a knife in front of them<br>
They wouldn't notice a thing<br><br>

And I know it's stupid how I let<br>
Everyone run my life<br>
But I can't fucking stop it's just<br>
How I pass the time<br>
Cause nothing fucking stays the same even<br>
After just two weeks<br>
In a month they're gone and here I am and<br>
My life stinks<br><br>

Yeah I feel like I'm going crazy<br>
Yeah people leave me daily<br>
My mind affects my body<br>
Every night leaves me foggy<br>
I'm breakable but I'm also not<br>
I'm breakable I can't fucking stop<br><br>

I feel like I'm getting stupid<br>
Yeah people don't care when I'm muted<br>
My mind affects my mood<br>
Jesus Christ my life is screwed<br>
I'm breakable but I'm also not<br>
I'm breakable I can't fucking stop</p>

	<p>I'm not invited to your parties<br>
I guess you never cared to ask<br>
Maybe you just wanted me to<br>
But that's a childish task<br><br>

You're not allowed to make me like you<br>
Then stay long enough to hurt me<br>
I wont let you paint me dark blue<br>
Just leave now better hurry<br><br>

I guess I've really gotta end it<br>
It seems like such a shame<br>
I know your love is a knife<br>
But your poison spread like a flame<br><br>

You're not allowed to make me like you<br>
Then stay long enough to hurt me<br>
I wont let you paint me dark blue<br>
Just leave now better hurry<br><br>

I don't care if you view me negatively<br>
Tell all your friends say that "He ghosted me"<br>
But I did it all to protect myself<br>
From a boy I know would put me on a shelf<br><br>

Oh oh<br>
Not us<br>
Oh oh<br>
Not you<br><br>

You can't play with my emotions then  <br>
Have zero consequences<br>
It's too unfair<br>
You can't have my attention then<br>
Leave us unmentioned<br>
Without a care<br><br>

You're not allowed to make me like you<br>
Then stay long enough to hurt me<br>

	<p>Fuck it I guess I'm lonely<br>
But I don't wanna be this way anymore<br>
I want somebody to hold me<br>
But I don't wanna see them Walking out the door<br><br>

Give me butterflies<br>
And a beautiful smile<br>
Don't you say goodbye<br>
I don't wanna be this way tonight<br><br>

I could be the boy you talk to<br>
I could be the one who loves you<br>
Promise that you'll keep me safe<br>
We'll be each other's great escape<br>
Just don't break my fragile heart<br>
Like the others don't make me start<br>
Dull the blade of that wretched knife<br>
And maybe start a brand new life<br><br>

Well fuck, now no one knows me<br>
I've been so closed off for so long<br>
I know love isn't free<br>
But I still stay hopeful with this song<br><br>

Give me butterflies<br>
And a beautiful smile<br>
Don't you say goodbye<br>
I don't wanna be this way tonight<br><br>

I could be the boy you talk to<br>

And maybe start a brand new life<br><br>

I can be your angel<br>
Not sad and lonely<br>
If I make your heart melt<br>
Please just tell me<br>
I wanna get to know you<br>
Through the depths of your soul<br>
And if you treat me right<br>
To show you mine's the goal<br><br>

I could be the boy you talk to<br>

	<h3 id="MARS">MARS</h3>
	<p>Back in august, I moved to mars<br>
Wasteland planet beneath the stars<br>
Sometimes peaceful, sometimes hell<br>
Honey I'm not doing so well<br>
I'm sometimes red, sometimes blue<br>
Always purple, bruises bloom<br>
I'm sometimes high, I'm always low<br>
I'll just go watch a TV show<br><br>

I'm looking for an answer<br>
Out among the stars<br>
The dead and barren streets<br>
Wondering how far<br>
"Nothing's enough anymore"<br>
I will always miss the past<br>
Till the devil knocks on my door<br>
Nothing seems to last<br><br>

On this planet I don't wanna see<br>
The ghosts of friends looking back at me<br>
They're barely there, it hurts to breathe<br>
Dust on the floor's what I wanna be<br><br>

I'm looking for an answer<br>
Out among the stars<br>
The dead and barren streets<br>
Wondering how far<br>
"Nothing's enough anymore"<br>
I will always miss the past<br>
Till the devil knocks on my door<br>
Nothing seems to last<br><br>

And when my demons come to crawl<br>
To make me numb or make me bawl<br>
There's a question that I scream<br>
When I'm bursting at the seams<br><br>

Now I'm lying on the floor yelling<br>
"How do I do this?<br>
How do I do this?<br>
How do I do this anymore?<br><br>

How do I do this?<br>
How do I do this?<br>
How do I fucking get through the week?<br>
Just a week of my life?<br>
I don't wanna do this anymore"</p>

My blood getting tired of flowing<br>
Tired of always getting upset<br>
My movements begin slowing<br><br>

Escitalopram stomachaches<br>
It'll be worth it when the fever breaks<br><br>

Clandestine cave with vines<br>
Singing with some real friends<br>
I wish I'd be there all the time<br>
Not wishing my life would end<br><br>

Escitalopram stomachaches<br>
It'll be worth it when the fever breaks<br><br>

Happy's something I can't find<br>
These pills make me wanna die<br>
I had to leave it all behind<br>
Onto bupropion, why?<br><br>

Do you remember?<br>
I bet that most don't<br>
You already don't<br><br>

The hypocrites miss me<br>
But if they knew only<br>
What they had to do<br>
To make me feel less blue<br>
Be fucking mad at me<br>
I don't care<br>
I swear you better be<br>

Do you regret?<br>

Why do they care<br>
As soon as I'm gone?<br>

Does my face haunt you?<br>
Hazel eyes near<br>
Eyeliner smudged through<br>
Crying and tears<br>
How sweet was my smile?<br>
Was it real enough?<br>
It lasted a while<br>
But then life grew tough<br>
Hated reflections<br>
Shattered mirrors<br>
Tried many distractions<br>
But nothing was clearer<br>
So fucking tired<br>
My whole world was ending<br>
My whole world was ending<br>
My whole world was ending<br><br>

Does anyone miss me?<br>
I hope that you miss me<br>
I hope that you do<br>
Does anyone miss me?<br>
I hope that you miss me<br>
I hope that you-</p>

	<p>Honestly, I<br>
Really just wanna cry<br>
Every night<br>
Before bed<br>
And I wish that I<br>
Didn't really want to die<br>
All the time<br>
In my head<br><br>

Whenever I smile, I hope it lasts a while to heal me<br>
I hope that someone really just wants to feel me<br>
At the end the day, what am I supposed to do?<br>
I bleed the color blue<br><br>

This life can be fun<br>
But whenever it's done<br>
No one's laughing<br>
Only tears<br>
Blue pen on my arm<br>
Layered on me like scars<br>
Cause I can't see<br>
You and me<br><br>

Whenever I smile, I hope it lasts a while to heal me<br>
I hope that someone really just wants to feel me<br>
At the end the day, what am I supposed to do?<br>
I bleed the color blue<br><br>

And I feel that you<br>
All color me blue<br>
But the world it seems is not for me<br>
Yeah what should I do?<br>
No option I could find<br>
Would fix broken time<br>
And let me down, I'll be around<br>
Yeah I'll see you tomorrow<br><br>

(Another day feeling breakable<br>
An angel with constant stomachaches<br>
left completely blind some days<br>
Named Mars<br>
Living in a mental wasteland<br>
But It's all so real<br>
Ghosting because I think it's not worth the pain<br>
Not us, not you<br>
But do we all live this way?<br>
An angel left thinking<br>
"Will I see you tomorrow?"<br>
Tell me it'll be okay<br>
That I'll see another day)<br><br>

	<p>Cleaning up confetti after the party<br>
No time limit or any tardy<br>
The fun is over<br>
The gig is done<br>
There's no "getting closure"<br>
Just sit with me and watch the rising sun<br><br>

My sweatshirt and a notepad<br>
Summer in my dark room<br>
I was too young to know that<br>
How much I was in gloom<br>
I didn't know what was to come<br>
I was young and I was dumb<br>
But am I still?<br><br>

There we are<br>
In the fields of grass<br>
Watching the stars<br>
My hand around a glass<br>
Wishing for the younger days<br>
When we didn't have to worry<br>
About not being in a haze<br>
It just gets blurry<br>
Some days<br><br>

It happened so quickly<br>
Pictures passed<br>
Now there's nobody with me<br>
How long did it last?<br>
Cause laying in bed<br>
Doesn't get nobody far<br>
Messing up my bedspread<br>
Maybe one day I'll be a star<br><br>

There we are<br>
In the fields of grass<br>
Watching the stars<br>
My hand around a glass<br>
Wishing for the younger days<br>
When we didn't have to worry<br>
About not being in a haze<br>
It just gets blurry<br>
Some days<br><br>

My blue bed<br>
With my blue desk<br>
And my blue head<br>
I put my head to rest<br>
My blue brush<br>
With my blue shirt<br>
And my head rush<br>
Broken and hurt<br>

There we are<br>
In the fields of grass<br>
Watching the stars<br>
My hand around a glass<br>
Wishing for the younger days<br>
When we didn't have to worry<br>
About not being in a haze<br>
It just gets blurry<br>
Some days<br>
Some days<br>
Some days<br>
Some days<br><br>

Cleaning up confetti after the party<br>
No time limit or any tardy<br>
The fun is over<br>
The gig is done<br>
There's no "getting closure"<br>
Just sit with me and watch the setting sun</p>
