	<h1>~ "demons" Lyrics ~</h1>
	<br>
	<h3>demons</h3>
	<p>You imply that the part of me<br>
That stands up for myself<br>
And defends me rightfully<br>
Is a demon that made me yell<br><br>

Don't you know that makes me feel crazy?<br>
And nor does it help<br>
Our camaraderie's getting hazy<br>
Makes me wanna belt<br><br>

Nothing is wrong with these "demons"<br>
Look in my eyes and know it's me<br>
I'm just expressing my feelings<br>
I just want everybody to see<br>
Nothing is wrong with these "demons"<br>
Nothing is wrong with these "demons"<br><br>

I don't need your approval you see<br>
Or validation to soothe<br>
But I just thought you'd believe me<br>
And I'd have nothing to prove<br>
Yeah<br><br>

Nothing is wrong with these "demons"<br>
Look in my eyes and know it's me<br>
I'm just expressing my feelings<br>
I just want everybody to see<br>
Nothing is wrong with these "demons"<br>
Nothing is wrong with these "demons"<br><br>

Don't you know I hid myself for years?<br>
They say "let it out" but once I do there's tears<br>
Why can't you just see?<br>
I shouldn't have to beg you to believe me<br>
What is it like to be believed<br>
The first time that you say something?<br><br>

Nothing is wrong with these "demons"<br>
Look in my eyes and know it's me<br>
I'm just expressing my feelings<br>
I just want everybody to see<br>
Nothing is wrong with these "demons"<br>
Nothing is wrong with these "demons"<br><br>

Nothing is wrong with these "demons"</p>
