	<p>So before we like, become friends I'd like to give you a warning<br><br>

Know me<br>
If you want to<br>
Show me<br>
That you'll stay<br><br>

Dis-moi que je suis fol<br>
I've heard it from them all<br>
I'm too much for everyone<br>
Don't say "It's fine" if you're gonna run<br><br>

And leave me alone<br>
Cause I'd rather be alone<br>
Than be left by who I love<br>
I hate that fatal shove<br><br>

Know me<br>
If you want to<br>
Show me<br>
That you'll stay<br><br>

I've got a history<br>
I'm a liability<br>
True stories I'll tell you<br>
Will seem like tragedies too<br><br>

Loving me is hugging a dying cactus<br>
I hurt but it hurts you too <br>
Knowing me is just such a burden<br>
I'm a problem, what can I do?<br><br>

I don't wanna be an issue you feel you wanna fix<br>
Cause there's no way to save someone halfway down the styx<br>
I’m a house fire that can’t be put out<br>
You can’t stop it by yourself now<br><br>

I’m nice, I’m fun, I’m insecure<br>
“Good advice” but are you sure?<br>
I’m empathetic and pathetic<br>
But at least not psychopathic<br><br>

Know me<br>
If you want to<br>
Show me<br>
That you'll stay<br><br>

I've got a history<br>
I'm a liability<br>
True stories I'll tell you<br>
Will seem like tragedies too<br><br>

Loving me is hugging a dying cactus<br>
I hurt but it hurts you too <br>
Knowing me is just such a burden<br>
I'm a problem, what can I do?<br><br>

Do I mastermind this shit and trick everyone<br>
Into being my friends and then start the fun<br>
Or do I warn them not to get close to me<br>
Because I don’t want them to ever leave<br><br>

I should do the selfless thing and warn you<br>
I’m a ticking time bomb about to go boom<br>
You shouldn’t stick around to get burned<br>
I will be the lesson that you have to learn<br><br>

I've got a history<br>
I'm a liability<br>
True stories I'll tell you<br>
Will seem like tragedies too<br><br>

Loving me is hugging a dying cactus<br>
I hurt but it hurts you too <br>
Knowing me is just such a burden<br>
I'm a problem, what can I do?<br><br>

Know me<br>
If you want to<br>
Show me<br>
That you'll sta-</p>

	<p>Every afternoon I have you on my mind<br>
But I know that you're far away, across the line<br>
I try to fill the void, but I can't find someone else<br>
I'm drowning in the social sea, I need some help<br><br>

I have a greenhouse of plenty for now<br>
But need someone to help build the world somehow<br>
Always absent, lacking goodbyes<br>
I taste belief and then you leave my side<br><br>
￼
You only come around once every blood moon <br>
Only to leave, and say that you'll see me soon<br>
And I look up to see the night sky<br>
And hope that by some chance I'll see red tonight<br><br>

You only come around once every blood moon <br>
To hang with me and dance to our favorite tune<br>
And I'll look up to see the night sky<br>
And hope that by some chance I'll see red tonight<br><br>

So like a ghost you disappear once again<br>
But I'm a kid on Christmas when you come back in<br>
I know you're busy and have your own life<br>
But I do too and you know I still try<br><br>

With barely any friends I'm looked down upon<br>
People just insult me and have their fun<br>
But they're just the largest of parasites<br>
Who see that I'm human when they look in my eyes<br><br>

You only come around once every blood moon <br>
Only to leave, and say that you'll see me soon<br>
And I look up to see the night sky<br>
And hope that by some chance I'll see red tonight<br><br>

You only come around once every blood moon <br>
To hang with me and dance to our favorite tune<br>
And I'll look up to see the night sky<br>
And hope that by some chance I'll see red tonight<br><br>

The one I long to be closer with<br>
Not have our talks be a total myth<br>
I light a candle and hope that the small flame<br>
Doesn't burn out and bring me so much pain<br><br>

You only come around once every blood moon <br>
Only to leave, and say that you'll see me soon<br>
And I look up to see the night sky<br>
And hope that by some chance I'll see red tonight<br><br>

You only come around once every blood moon <br>
To hang with me and dance to our favorite tune<br>
And I'll look up to see the night sky<br>
And hope that by some chance I'll see red tonight</p>

	<h3 id="pyck">promises you can't keep</h3>
	<p>A silhouette crossing the door frame<br>
I wonder if I took it too far<br>
Or if you did and you're giving me the blame<br>
This is my least favorite part<br><br>

Everyone eventually fucks up<br>
And doesn't wanna admit they're wrong<br>
You could've at least given a 'heads up'<br>
Before you got my hopes up too long<br><br>

I wish you handled me with delicacy<br>
That one night so I wouldn't be lonely<br><br>

You said you'd love me till the end of time<br>
But I know now all of that was a lie<br>
You said you couldn't hate me if you tried<br>
But now I reminisce on back when you were mine<br><br>

Don't make promises you can't keep <br>
Don't pretend like our connection was deep<br>
Cause clearly it wasn't for you to do that<br>
To betray your own promises, that's too bad<br><br>

Don't make promises you can't keep <br>
Don't pretend like our connection was deep<br>
Cause clearly it wasn't for you to do that<br>
To betray your own promises, that's too bad<br><br>

I never took you as a foolish liar<br>
Or a brute lacking empathy, fuel to the fire<br>
Why would you tell me you would never leave me?<br>
Don't make promises that you can't keep<br><br>

You said you'd love me till the end of time<br>
But I know now all of that was a lie<br>
You said you couldn't hate me if you tried<br>

	<h3 id="gt">ghost town</h3>
	<p>I thought I did everything right<br>
In the dark, for you I became a light<br>
Picked flowers, I chose all the right words<br>
So high, we said hello to the birds<br><br>

I built you a city on a cloud<br>
Then you left me with a ghost town<br>
I gave you my keys and a kiss<br>
You left me with red eyes in the mist<br><br>

You came over to watch a movie<br>
But I found out you just wanted my body<br>
I said I wanted to take it slow<br>
Then out the door I saw your body go<br><br>

I built you a city on a cloud<br>
Then you left me with a ghost town<br>
I gave you my keys and a kiss<br>
You left me with red eyes in the mist<br><br>

Now the door is closed<br>
You say I deserve better, I say I know<br>
Now I sit in this abandoned town<br>
Of what could've been before it drowned<br><br>

I built you a city on a cloud<br>
Then you left me with a ghost town<br>
I gave you my keys and a kiss<br>
You left me with red eyes in the mist

	<p>There's something so comforting<br>
About waiting around to die<br>
No thoughts in my mind<br>
Or time to question why<br>
Maybe I want to be this way<br>
Finding comfort in all the grey<br><br>

The dark clouds never clear<br>
I wish that I could disappear<br>
Under the ground<br>
Never to be found<br><br>

Walk right by me<br>
I don't care anymore<br>
I'll think of the sea<br>
As I walk out the door<br><br>

I'll just watch life as it shatters<br>
Cause nothing ever really matters<br>
I am gonna die anyway<br>
I'll sink in the soil at the end of the day<br><br>

I think when I sit in the yard<br>
This peace never lasts cause life deals its cards<br>
Time is numbered and I am too<br>
No time to think, ten assignments are due<br><br>

But I don't have anger<br>
I don't have regret<br>
I don't care at all<br>
Now I have no sweat<br><br>

Walk right by me<br>
I don't care anymore<br>
I'll think of the sea<br>
As I walk out the door<br><br>

I'll just watch life as it shatters<br>
Cause nothing ever really matters<br>
I am gonna die anyway<br>
I'll sink in the soil at the end of the day<br><br>

	<p>I stand watching the sun setting over the ocean<br>
And the waves tell my heart to open<br>
But I'm afraid the sun will leave me forever<br>
And it leaves just as I thought I was clever<br><br>

Oh it can't see this light<br>
I bring to the morning<br>
I bring in these tides<br>
When it's sunny or storming<br>
Oh the moon must rise<br>
And hold me closely<br>
Oh I wish that<br>
Good things would last<br><br>

You know I can't hold on forever<br>
For things that always stay never<br>
The moon told me<br>
It'd be back but just differently<br><br>

Oh it can't see this light<br>
I bring to the darkness<br>
I bring in these tides<br>
With their carefree and sharpness<br>
Oh the sun must rise<br>
And hold me closely<br>
Oh I wish that<br>
Good things would last<br><br>

I know they'll back<br>
They just won't remember me<br>
I'll feel the lack<br>
Cause I'll never be free</p>

	<p>Is it obvious<br>
That I still love you?<br>
That I savor us?<br>
That I want to?<br><br>

We are still friends<br>
But I still want more<br>
To not let this end<br>
To reopen that door<br><br>

When you're near I'm fine<br>
But I miss you all the time<br>
And when I'm in your arms<br>
I still feel all your charms<br><br>

When I look up at you<br>
And think, I still feel blue<br>
There's nothing I can do<br>
But I still love you<br><br>

I remember that night on the beach<br>
When I restated my feelings through<br>
That though what your parents preach<br>
I still want you<br><br>

Our sparks still seem to cut through<br>
I sit in front of that door<br>
It's open a crack I see you<br>
I peek but still I want more<br><br>

When you're near I'm fine<br>
But I miss you all the time<br>
And when I'm in your arms<br>
I still feel all your charms<br><br>

When I look up at you<br>
And think, I still feel blue<br>
There's nothing I can do<br>
But I still love you<br><br>

When you're gone I feel alone<br>
I'll miss you till the end of time<br>
And until then when we are grown<br>
I'll say I'm fine and start to cry<br><br>

When I look up at you<br>
And think, I still feel blue<br>
There's nothing I can do<br>
But I still love you<br><br>

When you're near I'm fine<br>
But I miss you all the time<br>
And when I'm in your arms<br>

	<p>Why does nobody know things that are obvious?<br>
It's like they're blind<br>
To this phenomenon so sad and ravenous<br>
I'd like this to unwind<br><br>

There's a cracked-up creature<br>
That sleeps under my bed<br>
It waits for me to let down my guard<br>
So that I could end up dead<br>
Or maybe snatch an arm or two<br>
He could do it if he wanted to<br>
He could cook my head in a stew<br>
Nobody knows so please get a clue<br><br>

Everybody vomits words that coax the creature out<br>
But they're clueless<br>
Self righteous indignation when I cover up the spout<br>
So relentless<br><br>

	<p>It's not funny<br>
Other people's trauma<br>
You never stop talking<br>
Let me add a comma<br>
There's no god damn compromise<br>
Cause nobody opens their eyes<br>
Empty promises don't even bother<br>
As reliable as a deadbeat father<br><br>

Hiding your insults behind jokes<br>
I see through your pretty hoax<br>
Is this rude? I don't give a fuck<br>
I hope this hits like a semi truck<br>
Insult humor<br>
Ruins friendships<br>
Venom in veins<br>
Causing an eclipse<br><br>

It's not ever funny<br>
Making my skin itch<br>
Get offended when I fight back<br>
You're a hypocrite bitch<br>
There's no god damn compromise<br>
Cause nobody opens their eyes<br>
Empty promises don't even bother<br>
Toxic shits get along with one another<br><br>

Hiding your insults behind jokes<br>
I see through your pretty hoax<br>
Is this rude? I don't give a fuck<br>
I hope this hits like a semi truck<br>
Insult humor<br>

Venom in veins<br>
Causing an eclipse<br><br>

If you never respect me<br>
I will never respect you<br>
If you don't change eventually<br>
For you there will be no room<br><br>

I'm tired of being walked all over<br>
I'm tired of condescending people<br>
Invalidate me, ruin my mood<br>
You give me such attitude<br><br>

I have worked on self esteem<br>
Confidence I want to see<br>
Not to live here just to please<br>
In my life you're a bad disease<br><br>

I have tried my whole damn life<br>
To get along with everyone and just be nice<br>
But I don't let myself be a doormat<br>
I don't let myself tolerate that<br><br>

Once I got a good self esteem<br>
All the motherfuckers say I'm so mean<br>
While I've been trying to get clean<br>
You act ten when you're actually a teen<br><br>

The ones who stick around you<br>
Are just like you or they're doormats too<br>
There's the difference between them and I<br>
They get used until they die<br><br>

Hiding your insults behind jokes<br>
I see through your pretty hoax<br>
Is this rude? I don't give a fuck<br>
I hope this hits like a semi truck<br>

I could live here<br>
Sleep in the bathtub<br>
The water hides my tears<br>
Welcome to the club<br><br>

If I could have some more time<br>
A place to go where I can hide<br>
When things just won't get better<br>
I'm underneath the weather<br>
But I know I can't stay here forever<br>
So I drown my feelings, walk out looking better<br>
I drown my feelings, walk out looking better<br><br>

If only there were more time in life<br>
Cause I just need a break tonight<br>
Alone in my room<br>
But this will have to do</p>

	<p>You know that it's true<br>
Things won't work between me and you<br>
Oh it's what they say, "right person wrong time"<br>
If we stayed friends would it be a crime?<br><br>

I can't help but imagine<br>
What could've been<br><br>

In another life<br>
I could be your lover<br>
In another life<br>
There would be no other but<br>
Here I'll take you as a souvenir<br><br>

The memory of you will treat me well<br>
As soon as I fall under a different spell<br>
But right now it's so hard to bear<br>
Things will get better I'm well aware<br><br>

But I can't help but imagine<br>

Thank you for the memories<br>
Won't you just stay with me please?<br>
Even if life takes you away from me<br>
I think these things before I sleep<br><br>

I know we're not together<br>
I wish I could stay forever<br>
I don't want it to be true<br>
But I still fucking love you<br><br>

I've never met no one like you<br>
And without you I will be blue<br>
Nobody else interests me<br>
I won't get over you easily<br><br>

In another life<br>

Hey, we meet once again<br>
Tonight in this room<br>
We do the usual<br>
Talk and stare at the moon<br><br>

Out of the window<br>
The view is so nice<br>
Won't last forever<br>
But this will suffice<br><br>

If things were different<br>
I'd go for broke<br>
Go for broke<br>
Go for broke<br><br>

But since they aren't I left<br>
Before you woke<br>
Before you woke<br>
Before you woke<br><br>

If I could I'd marry this comfort<br>
And it would be alright<br>
We'd sleep in the same bed<br>
Every single night<br><br>

Here's the only place<br>
We can see each other<br>
Tomorrow I leave but<br>
For now I pull the covers<br><br>

If things were different<br>
I'd go for broke<br>
Go for broke<br>
Go for broke<br><br>

But since they aren't I left<br>
Before you woke<br>
Before you woke<br>
Before you woke<br><br>

And you know the puzzle pieces<br>
Of our lives don't fit<br>
But even that doesn't<br>
Make me wanna quit<br><br>

So we'll make the most of what we have<br>
And keep the memories of what we had<br>
Shut off the days that make us sad<br>
We'll fantasize and just be glad that<br><br>

If things were different<br>
We'd go for broke<br>
Go for broke<br>
Go for broke<br><br>

But since they aren't I left<br>
Before you woke<br>
Before you woke<br>
Before you woke<br><br>

If things were different<br>
We'd go for broke<br>
Go for broke<br>
Go for broke<br><br>

But since they aren't I left<br>

I have to wake up in five hours<br>
Already spent two in bed<br>

I just wish I was dead<br><br>

Checking my alarm clock<br>
Over and over again<br>
Fidgeting with my socks<br>
I should've slept at ten<br>
Hung up on life<br>
And things I have to do<br>
But I never have time<br>
Cause now it's almost two<br><br>

It's like sleep is a program<br>
In the computer of my mind<br>
That no matter how many times I ran<br>
It hasn't responded all night<br>
Close the software<br>
Reboot it all<br>
Just cause I care<br>
I'm not trying to stall<br><br>

Checking my alarm clock<br>
Over and over again<br>
Fidgeting with my socks<br>
I should've slept at ten<br>
Hung up on life<br>
And things I have to do<br>
But I never have time<br>
Cause now it's almost two<br><br>

I guess I'll down some melatonin<br>
Before twelve so I can sleep<br>
And hope that it will sink in<br>
For at least six hours deep</p>

	<p>I'll drive alone through the streets of this town<br>
Looking out at the people around<br>
I will admire them before we fall away<br>
Cause the world ends today<br><br>

There's one garden left in the world now<br>
For things to end up like this I don't know how<br>
So when my mother tells me to exercise<br>
I'll light the house on fire with these eyes<br><br>

I'll drive to work every day<br>
Hoping my fear will go away<br>
Even though I know it won't<br>
I think about it they tell me don't<br>
And maybe if I go to the park<br>
Daily I won't be a shark<br>
In a pool full of my own blood<br>
Or in the dark on my knees in the mud<br><br>

There's one garden left in the world now<br>
For things to end up like this I don't know how<br>
So when my mother starts to magnify<br>
I'll say I'm done with trying to satisfy<br>
There's one garden left in the world now<br>
For things to end up like this I don't know how<br>
So when my father tells me to dry my eyes<br>
I'll say that's the kind of shit that makes me despise<br><br>

You all just don't understand<br>
I don't need you to hold my hand<br>
None of this shit has been planned<br>
No more gardens, no more land<br>
When I drive at night<br>
I'll wish the world was a wasteland<br>
And that a ditch could hold me tight<br>
Keep me safe from a life so bland<br>
Surely the dark will let me in<br>
Cause nobody else ever did<br>
This way maybe I will win<br>
At life leaving my kin<br><br>

I'll lie to every therapist, psychiatrist <br>
And adult in my life<br>
Think about it every day, all the time<br>
Where's my knife?<br><br>

There's one garden left in the world now<br>
For things to end up like this I dont know how<br>
So when my parents ask me why<br>
Instead of answering I'll just fucking sigh<br><br>

For shit to end up like this I dont know how<br>
For things to fuck up like this I dont know how<br>
For shit to end up like this I dont know how<br>
For things to fuck up like this I don't know how</p>
