	<p>I don't know<br>
Neither do you<br>
How we rose<br>
Or when we're due<br><br>

Why do we call it a sunset <br>
If we know the sun doesn't move?<br>
I'm fine with not knowing<br>
What's out beyond the moon<br><br>

We'll all be gone<br>
Before we know the truth<br>
So let's mow the lawn<br>
And keep trying to soothe<br><br>

Everybody on the earth<br>
Has their ideas bout what's out there<br>
But I don't care I see my worth <br>
I live in the present, nowadays that's rare<br><br>

Why do we call it a sunset <br>
If we know the sun doesn't move?<br>
I'm fine with not knowing<br>
What's out beyond the moon<br><br>

We'll all be gone<br>
Before we know the truth<br>
So let's mow our lawns<br>
And keep trying to soothe

	<p>Thought that it was over<br>
But it clung on like glue<br>
Thought that I would be saved<br>
Nothing I could do<br><br>

Problems never go away<br>
You solve them or let them sit<br>
But more just keep coming<br>
I can't accept the fact that this is it<br><br>

There will always be a sadder day<br>
I can't ever stop the bleeding <br>
There will always be a price I pay<br>
For just living, despite my pleading<br><br>

This is just the way things are<br>
Bones get broken again and again<br>
I could keep wishing on a star<br>
But bones are just made to be broken<br><br>

Now I want to live <br>
I one-eighty'd the path<br>
But on the other road<br>
A mirror sits and laughs<br><br>

Everything in the kitchen<br>
Has a set of eyes<br>
The words that I heard whispered<br>
I wish I knew were lies<br><br>

There will always be a sadder day<br>
I can't ever stop the bleeding <br>
There will always be a price I pay<br>
For just living, despite my pleading<br><br>

This is just the way things are<br>
Bones get broken again and again<br>
I could keep wishing on a star<br>
But bones are just made to be broken<br><br>

If you have gotten over the hurdle<br>
There's always a sadder day<br>
Sadder than you thought it would be <br>
The only constant is pain<br><br>

Maybe pain lets me grow<br>
I don't wanna reap what I don't sow<br>
I have to let my heart break<br>
But I just need a break<br><br>

There will always be a sadder day<br>
I can't ever stop the bleeding <br>
There will always be a price I pay<br>
For just living, despite my pleading<br><br>

This is just the way things are<br>
Bones get broken again and again<br>
I could keep wishing on a star<br>
But bones are just made to be broken<br><br>

There will always be a sadder day<br>
I can't ever stop the bleeding <br>
There will always be a price I pay<br>
For just living, despite my pleading<br><br>

This is just the way things are<br>
Bones get broken again and again<br>
I could keep wishing on a star<br>
But bones are just made to be broken</p>

	<h3 id="lucenteyes">lucent eyes</h3>
	<p>Blue wings in my stomach when you catch my eye<br>
When you look at me I feel like I could die<br>
The deep blue I could see away from a mile<br>
The only issue is who will pick up and dial<br><br>

I wanna be you, I wanna be you<br>
I wanna see you, I wanna see you<br>
I wanna hold you, I wanna hold you<br>
I wanna kiss you, I wanna kiss you<br><br>

Ooh I die a little when you walk by<br>
Ooh I cry a little when I get back home<br>
Do I want you to be mine?<br>
Or do I want to be you as I roam?<br><br>

Every feature, everything <br>
From head to toe, you shine like bling<br>
Lucent eyes, I fantasize<br>
Putting your lips on mine<br><br>

You're an arcane garden full of red chrysanthemums <br>
I'd die to get in but I have yet to get invited<br>
You're a forbidden fruit hiding in plain sight till somebody comes<br>
You're always in season, you've got me delighted<br><br>

I wanna be you, I wanna be you<br>
I wanna see you, I wanna see you<br>
I wanna hold you, I wanna hold you<br>
I wanna kiss you, I wanna kiss you<br><br>

Ooh I die a little when you walk by<br>
Ooh I cry a little when I get back home<br>
Do I want you to be mine?<br>
Or do I want to be you as I roam?<br><br>

Every feature, everything <br>
From head to toe, you shine like bling<br>
Lucent eyes, I fantasize<br>
Putting your lips on mine<br><br>

You're magnetic to me<br>
When you walk away I feel a pull <br>
You make me crazy<br>
When you talk to me, my heart is full<br><br>

I don't even care if you dont feel the same<br>
The way that I see you is never tame<br>
I'll take you as a friend, a lover, or otherwise<br>
Just don't be a stranger to my eyes<br><br>

When I was singing "Gorgeous" in that crowded room I was looking at you<br>
This pining is painful every day we don't talk <br>
I wanna scream in my dorm in the blue<br><br>

Walking alone in the dark just us two<br>
You say goodnight and I miss the view<br>
Did you walk away and think: "what a nice friend"?<br>
Cause I walked away feeling like I'd ascend<br><br>

Ooh I die a little when you walk by<br>
Ooh I cry a little when I get back home<br>
Do I want you to be mine?<br>
Or do I want to be you as I roam?<br><br>

Every feature, everything <br>
From head to toe, you shine like bling<br>
Lucent eyes, I fantasize<br>
Putting your lips on mine<br><br>

Our shoulders touching in the dark<br>
My right and your left<br>
The whole ride home in the car<br>
But then it stopped and I left</p>
