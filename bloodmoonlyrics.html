	<h1>~ "blood moon" Lyrics ~</h1>
	<br>
	<h3>blood moon</h3>
	<p>Every afternoon I have you on my mind<br>
But I know that you're far away, across the line<br>
I try to fill the void, but I can't find someone else<br>
I'm drowning in the social sea, I need some help<br><br>

I have a greenhouse of plenty for now<br>
But need someone to help build the world somehow<br>
Always absent, lacking goodbyes<br>
I taste belief and then you leave my side<br><br>
ï¿¼
You only come around once every blood moon <br>
Only to leave, and say that you'll see me soon<br>
And I look up to see the night sky<br>
And hope that by some chance I'll see red tonight<br><br>

You only come around once every blood moon <br>
To hang with me and dance to our favorite tune<br>
And I'll look up to see the night sky<br>
And hope that by some chance I'll see red tonight<br><br>

So like a ghost you disappear once again<br>
But I'm a kid on Christmas when you come back in<br>
I know you're busy and have your own life<br>
But I do too and you know I still try<br><br>

With barely any friends I'm looked down upon<br>
People just insult me and have their fun<br>
But they're just the largest of parasites<br>
Who see that I'm human when they look in my eyes<br><br>

You only come around once every blood moon <br>
Only to leave, and say that you'll see me soon<br>
And I look up to see the night sky<br>
And hope that by some chance I'll see red tonight<br><br>

You only come around once every blood moon <br>
To hang with me and dance to our favorite tune<br>
And I'll look up to see the night sky<br>
And hope that by some chance I'll see red tonight<br><br>

The one I long to be closer with<br>
Not have our talks be a total myth<br>
I light a candle and hope that the small flame<br>
Doesn't burn out and bring me so much pain<br><br>

You only come around once every blood moon <br>
Only to leave, and say that you'll see me soon<br>
And I look up to see the night sky<br>
And hope that by some chance I'll see red tonight<br><br>

You only come around once every blood moon <br>
To hang with me and dance to our favorite tune<br>
And I'll look up to see the night sky<br>
And hope that by some chance I'll see red tonight</p>
