	<h1>~ "dreamlike" Lyrics ~</h1>
	<br>
	<h3>dreamlike</h3>
	<p>My skin like butter<br>
In the hot hot sun<br>
When you're around<br>
I come undone<br><br>

You kinda make me ache<br>
The icing on the cake<br>
Feels like a simulation<br>
Afraid of confrontation<br><br>

When you said that I'm a god<br>
Did you really mean it?<br>
And when you said that I'm hot<br>
Did you really see it?<br><br>

You don't mind when I cry<br>
You're such a nice guy<br>
You're quite a lightning strike<br>
Loving you is dreamlike<br><br>

Now I let you in the back door<br>
Stay a while, come around more<br>
Put me under you, put me under you<br>
Until when you say my name I say "who?"<br><br>

When you said that I'm a god<br>
Did you really mean it?<br>
And when you said that I'm hot<br>
Did you really see it?<br><br>

You don't mind when I cry<br>
You're such a nice guy<br>
You're quite a lightning strike<br>
Loving you is dreamlike<br><br>

If you saw inside my mind<br>
You might lose your mind<br>
I know you know I'm kind<br>
I think I want you to be mine<br><br>

When you said that I'm a god<br>
Did you really mean it?<br>
And when you said that I'm hot<br>
Did you really see it?<br><br>

You don't mind when I cry<br>
You're such a nice guy<br>
You're quite a lightning strike<br>
Loving you is dreamlike
