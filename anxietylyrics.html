	<h1>~ "anxiety" Lyrics ~</h1>
	<br>
	<h3>anxiety</h3>
	<p>I have some issues not<br>
Worrying about what'll happen<br>
And I have a lot of thoughts<br>
But I'll just try to make it<br><br>

And I know<br>
They can't<br>
Possibly see me<br><br>

And I can't go on any longer<br>
But I can't go away<br>
Just let me be a bit stronger<br>
So I get through and stay<br><br>

And I can't stop feeling this hunger<br>
And it won't go away<br>
Just let me know if I made a blunder<br>
So I get through and stay stay stay stay<br><br>

They must be staring at me<br>
But not for good reason<br>
I wanna run and hide<br>
And sing a melody<br><br>

And I know<br>
They can't<br>
Possibly see me<br><br>

And I can't go on any longer<br>
But I can't go away<br>
Just let me be a bit stronger<br>
So I get through and stay<br><br>

And I can't stop feeling this hunger<br>
And it won't go away<br>
Just let me know if I made a blunder<br>
So I get through and stay stay stay stay<br><br>

No, I can't see myself<br>
In the mirror<br>
I can't breathe in this hell<br>
But now it's clearer<br><br>

I still can't go on any longer<br>
And I can't go away<br>
Just let me be a bit stronger<br>
So one day I could stay<br><br>

And I can't stop feeling this hunger<br>
And it won't go away<br>
Just let me know if I made a blunder<br>
So I get through and stay stay stay stay
