	<h1>~ "nightshade" Lyrics ~</h1>
	<br>
	<h3>nightshade</h3>
	<p>Can you keep me up all night?<br>
If I wanna get out<br>
Can you keep me out of sight?<br>
Just show me how<br><br>

And it's so hard to be alone<br>
but it makes me feel so addicted<br>
to shut them out, to be unknown<br>
All of it has me conflicted<br><br>

Sometimes my life feels like a psychodrama<br>
Because every day I'm afraid I'm gonna<br>
End up more alone and fucked up in the head<br>
Makes me wanna sleep all day and only stay in bed<br><br>

In bed no problems get me <br>
No people gonna hurt me <br>
Twist my brain, throw me in flames<br>
Hit by a train, Make me insane<br><br>

I don't want the pain<br><br>

Every damn depressed night<br>
A slasher chases me <br>
Every psychological fight<br>
They kill me don't you see?<br>

And I'm no final girl<br>
I'm the one they kill off first<br>
The plot twist in this song<br>
The killer was me all along <br><br>

Sometimes my life feels like a psychodrama<br>
Because every day I'm afraid I'm gonna<br>
End up more alone and fucked up in the head<br>
Makes me wanna sleep all day and only stay in bed<br><br>

In bed no problems get me <br>
No people gonna hurt me <br>
Twist my brain, throw me in flames<br>
Hit by a train, Make me insane<br><br>

I don't want the pain<br><br>

And here comes the final confrontation <br>
I'm the only one who does the narration<br>
The final struggle is between two versions of me<br>
Whichever one wins is still unknown you see<br><br>

It's always like those books <br>
That end on the hook<br>
That leave you hanging on a cliff<br>
That leave you frozen fucking stiff<br><br>

Sometimes my life feels like a psychodrama<br>
Because every day I'm afraid I'm gonna<br>
End up more alone and fucked up in the head<br>
Makes me wanna sleep all day and only stay in bed<br><br>

In bed no problems get me <br>
No people gonna hurt me <br>
Twist my brain, throw me in flames<br>
Hit by a train, Make me insane<br><br>

I don't want the pain</p>
